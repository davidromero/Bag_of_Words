﻿MANIFESTO OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY | communistmanifesto
[From the English edition of 1888, edited by Friedrich Engels] | communistmanifesto
A spectre is haunting Europe--the spectre of Communism. | communistmanifesto
All the Powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to | communistmanifesto
exorcise this spectre: Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, | communistmanifesto
French Radicals and German police-spies. | communistmanifesto
Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as | communistmanifesto
Communistic by its opponents in power?  Where is the Opposition | communistmanifesto
that has not hurled back the branding reproach of Communism, | communistmanifesto
against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against | communistmanifesto
its reactionary adversaries? | communistmanifesto
Two things result from this fact. | communistmanifesto
I.  Communism is already acknowledged by all European Powers | communistmanifesto
to be itself a Power. | communistmanifesto
II.  It is high time that Communists should openly, in the | communistmanifesto
face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their | communistmanifesto
tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of | communistmanifesto
Communism with a Manifesto of the party itself. | communistmanifesto
To this end, Communists of various nationalities have | communistmanifesto
assembled in London, and sketched the following Manifesto, to be | communistmanifesto
published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and | communistmanifesto
Danish languages. | communistmanifesto
I.  BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS | communistmanifesto
The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history | communistmanifesto
of class struggles. | communistmanifesto
Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, | communistmanifesto
guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, | communistmanifesto
stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an | communistmanifesto
uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time | communistmanifesto
ended, either in a revolutionary re-constitution of society at | communistmanifesto
large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes. | communistmanifesto
In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a | communistmanifesto
complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a | communistmanifesto
manifold gradation of social rank.  In ancient Rome we have | communistmanifesto
patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, | communistmanifesto
feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, | communistmanifesto
serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate | communistmanifesto
gradations. | communistmanifesto
The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins | communistmanifesto
of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms.  It | communistmanifesto
has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, | communistmanifesto
new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.  Our epoch, the | communistmanifesto
epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive | communistmanifesto
feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a | communistmanifesto
whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, | communistmanifesto
into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie | communistmanifesto
and Proletariat. | communistmanifesto
From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers | communistmanifesto
of the earliest towns.  From these burgesses the first elements | communistmanifesto
of the bourgeoisie were developed. | communistmanifesto
The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up | communistmanifesto
fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and | communistmanifesto
Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with | communistmanifesto
the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in | communistmanifesto
commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to | communistmanifesto
industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the | communistmanifesto
revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid | communistmanifesto
development. | communistmanifesto
The feudal system of industry, under which industrial production | communistmanifesto
was monopolised by closed guilds, now no longer sufficed for the | communistmanifesto
growing wants of the new markets.  The manufacturing system took | communistmanifesto
its place.  The guild-masters were pushed on one side by the | communistmanifesto
manufacturing middle class; division of labour between the | communistmanifesto
different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of | communistmanifesto
labour in each single workshop. | communistmanifesto
Meantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. | communistmanifesto
Even manufacture no longer sufficed.  Thereupon, steam and | communistmanifesto
machinery revolutionised industrial production.  The place of | communistmanifesto
manufacture was taken by the giant, Modern Industry, the place of | communistmanifesto
the industrial middle class, by industrial millionaires, the | communistmanifesto
leaders of whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois. | communistmanifesto
Modern industry has established the world-market, for which the | communistmanifesto
discovery of America paved the way.  This market has given an | communistmanifesto
immense development to commerce, to navigation, to communication | communistmanifesto
by land.  This development has, in its time, reacted on the | communistmanifesto
extension of industry; and in proportion as industry, commerce, | communistmanifesto
navigation, railways extended, in the same proportion the | communistmanifesto
bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed into the | communistmanifesto
background  every class handed down from the Middle Ages. | communistmanifesto
We see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the | communistmanifesto
product of a long course of development, of a series of | communistmanifesto
revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange. | communistmanifesto
Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied | communistmanifesto
by a corresponding political advance of that class.  An | communistmanifesto
oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an | communistmanifesto
armed and self-governing association in the mediaeval commune; | communistmanifesto
here independent urban republic (as in Italy and Germany), | communistmanifesto
there taxable "third estate" of the monarchy (as in France), | communistmanifesto
afterwards, in the  period of manufacture proper, serving either | communistmanifesto
the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise | communistmanifesto
against the nobility, and, in fact, corner-stone of the great | communistmanifesto
monarchies in general, the bourgeoisie has at last, since the | communistmanifesto
establishment of Modern Industry and of the world-market, | communistmanifesto
conquered for itself, in the modern representative State, | communistmanifesto
exclusive political sway.  The executive of the modern State is | communistmanifesto
but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole | communistmanifesto
bourgeoisie. | communistmanifesto
The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary | communistmanifesto
part. | communistmanifesto
The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an | communistmanifesto
end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations.  It has | communistmanifesto
pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to | communistmanifesto
his "natural superiors," and has left remaining no other nexus | communistmanifesto
between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous "cash | communistmanifesto
payment."  It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of | communistmanifesto
religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine | communistmanifesto
sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation.  It | communistmanifesto
has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of | communistmanifesto
the numberless and indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that | communistmanifesto
single, unconscionable freedom--Free Trade.  In one word, for | communistmanifesto
exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, naked, | communistmanifesto
shameless, direct, brutal exploitation. | communistmanifesto
The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation | communistmanifesto
hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe.  It has | communistmanifesto
converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the | communistmanifesto
man of science, into its paid wage labourers. | communistmanifesto
The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental | communistmanifesto
veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money | communistmanifesto
relation. | communistmanifesto
The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the | communistmanifesto
brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages, which Reactionists | communistmanifesto
so much admire, found its fitting complement in the most slothful | communistmanifesto
indolence.  It has been the first to show what man's activity can | communistmanifesto
bring about.  It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian | communistmanifesto
pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has | communistmanifesto
conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses | communistmanifesto
of nations and crusades. | communistmanifesto
The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising | communistmanifesto
the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of | communistmanifesto
production, and with them the whole relations of society. | communistmanifesto
Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, | communistmanifesto
was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all | communistmanifesto
earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionising of | communistmanifesto
production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, | communistmanifesto
everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois | communistmanifesto
epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, | communistmanifesto
with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and | communistmanifesto
opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated | communistmanifesto
before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all | communistmanifesto
that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face | communistmanifesto
with sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his | communistmanifesto
relations with his kind. | communistmanifesto
The need of a constantly expanding market for its products | communistmanifesto
chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe. It | communistmanifesto
must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions | communistmanifesto
everywhere. | communistmanifesto
The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world-market | communistmanifesto
given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in | communistmanifesto
every country.  To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it has | communistmanifesto
drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on | communistmanifesto
which it stood.  All old-established national industries have | communistmanifesto
been destroyed or are daily being destroyed.  They are dislodged | communistmanifesto
by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death | communistmanifesto
question for all civilised nations, by industries that no longer | communistmanifesto
work up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the | communistmanifesto
remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only | communistmanifesto
at home, but in every quarter of the globe.  In place of the old | communistmanifesto
wants, satisfied by the productions of the country, we find new | communistmanifesto
wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant | communistmanifesto
lands and climes.  In place of the old local and national | communistmanifesto
seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every | communistmanifesto
direction, universal inter-dependence of nations.  And as in | communistmanifesto
material, so also in intellectual production.  The intellectual | communistmanifesto
creations of individual nations become common property.  National | communistmanifesto
one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more | communistmanifesto
impossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures, | communistmanifesto
there arises a world literature. | communistmanifesto
The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of | communistmanifesto
production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, | communistmanifesto
draws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation. | communistmanifesto
The cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with | communistmanifesto
which it batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the | communistmanifesto
barbarians' intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to | communistmanifesto
capitulate.  It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to | communistmanifesto
adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to | communistmanifesto
introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst, i.e., to | communistmanifesto
become bourgeois themselves.  In one word, it creates a world | communistmanifesto
after its own image. | communistmanifesto
The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the | communistmanifesto
towns.  It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the | communistmanifesto
urban population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued | communistmanifesto
a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural | communistmanifesto
life.  Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so | communistmanifesto
it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on | communistmanifesto
the civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois, | communistmanifesto
the East on the West. | communistmanifesto
The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the | communistmanifesto
scattered state of the population, of the means of production, | communistmanifesto
and of property.  It has agglomerated production, and has | communistmanifesto
concentrated property in a few hands.  The necessary consequence | communistmanifesto
of this was political centralisation.  Independent, or but | communistmanifesto
loosely connected provinces, with separate interests, laws, | communistmanifesto
governments and systems of taxation, became lumped together into | communistmanifesto
one nation, with one government, one code of laws, one national | communistmanifesto
class-interest, one frontier and one customs-tariff.  The | communistmanifesto
bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has | communistmanifesto
created more massive and more colossal productive forces than | communistmanifesto
have all preceding generations together.  Subjection of Nature's | communistmanifesto
forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry | communistmanifesto
and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, | communistmanifesto
clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of | communistmanifesto
rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground--what | communistmanifesto
earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive | communistmanifesto
forces slumbered in the lap of social labour? | communistmanifesto
We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose | communistmanifesto
foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in | communistmanifesto
feudal society.  At a certain stage in the development of these | communistmanifesto
means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which | communistmanifesto
feudal society produced and exchanged, the feudal organisation of | communistmanifesto
agriculture and manufacturing industry, in one word, the feudal | communistmanifesto
relations of property became no longer compatible with the | communistmanifesto
already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters. | communistmanifesto
They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder. | communistmanifesto
Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a | communistmanifesto
social and political constitution adapted to it, and by the | communistmanifesto
economical and political sway of the bourgeois class. | communistmanifesto
A similar movement is going on before our own eyes.  Modern | communistmanifesto
bourgeois society with its relations of production, of exchange | communistmanifesto
and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic | communistmanifesto
means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer, who is | communistmanifesto
no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he | communistmanifesto
has called up by his spells.  For many a decade past the history | communistmanifesto
of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of | communistmanifesto
modern productive forces against modern conditions of production, | communistmanifesto
against the property relations that are the conditions for the | communistmanifesto
existence of the bourgeoisie and of its rule.  It is enough to | communistmanifesto
mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put | communistmanifesto
on its trial, each time more threateningly, the existence of the | communistmanifesto
entire bourgeois society.  In these crises a great part not only | communistmanifesto
of the existing products, but also of the previously created | communistmanifesto
productive forces, are periodically destroyed.  In these crises | communistmanifesto
there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would | communistmanifesto
have seemed an absurdity--the epidemic of over-production. | communistmanifesto
Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary | communistmanifesto
barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of | communistmanifesto
devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; | communistmanifesto
industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why?  Because | communistmanifesto
there is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, | communistmanifesto
too much industry, too much commerce.  The productive forces at | communistmanifesto
the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development | communistmanifesto
of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they | communistmanifesto
have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are | communistmanifesto
fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring | communistmanifesto
disorder into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the | communistmanifesto
existence of bourgeois property.  The conditions of bourgeois | communistmanifesto
society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them. | communistmanifesto
And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises?  On the one | communistmanifesto
hand inforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the | communistmanifesto
other, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough | communistmanifesto
exploitation of the old ones.  That is to say, by paving the | communistmanifesto
way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by | communistmanifesto
diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented. | communistmanifesto
The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the | communistmanifesto
ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself. | communistmanifesto
But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring | communistmanifesto
death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who | communistmanifesto
are to wield those weapons--the modern working class--the | communistmanifesto
proletarians. | communistmanifesto
In proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed, | communistmanifesto
in the same proportion is the proletariat, the modern working | communistmanifesto
class, developed--a class of labourers, who live only so long | communistmanifesto
as they find work, and who find work only so long as their labour | communistmanifesto
increases capital.  These labourers, who must sell themselves | communistmanifesto
piece-meal, are a commodity, like every other article of | communistmanifesto
commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of | communistmanifesto
competition, to all the fluctuations of the market. | communistmanifesto
Owing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of | communistmanifesto
labour, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual | communistmanifesto
character, and consequently, all charm for the workman.  He | communistmanifesto
becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most | communistmanifesto
simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is | communistmanifesto
required of him.  Hence, the cost of production of a workman is | communistmanifesto
restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he | communistmanifesto
requires for his maintenance, and for the propagation of his | communistmanifesto
race.  But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of | communistmanifesto
labour, is equal to its cost of production.  In proportion | communistmanifesto
therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage | communistmanifesto
decreases.  Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and | communistmanifesto
division of labour increases, in the same proportion the burden | communistmanifesto
of toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working | communistmanifesto
hours, by increase of the work exacted in a given time or by | communistmanifesto
increased speed of the machinery, etc. | communistmanifesto
Modern industry has converted the little workshop of the | communistmanifesto
patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial | communistmanifesto
capitalist.  Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are | communistmanifesto
organised like soldiers.  As privates of the industrial army they | communistmanifesto
are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers | communistmanifesto
and sergeants.  Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, | communistmanifesto
and of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by | communistmanifesto
the machine, by the over-looker, and, above all, by the | communistmanifesto
individual bourgeois manufacturer himself.  The more openly this | communistmanifesto
despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, | communistmanifesto
the more hateful and the more embittering it is. | communistmanifesto
The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual | communistmanifesto
labour, in other words, the more modern industry becomes | communistmanifesto
developed, the more is the labour of men superseded by that of | communistmanifesto
women. Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive | communistmanifesto
social validity for the working class. All are instruments of | communistmanifesto
labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age | communistmanifesto
and sex. | communistmanifesto
No sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer, | communistmanifesto
so far at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is | communistmanifesto
set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord, | communistmanifesto
the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc. | communistmanifesto
The lower strata of the middle class--the small tradespeople, | communistmanifesto
shopkeepers, retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and | communistmanifesto
peasants--all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly | communistmanifesto
because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale | communistmanifesto
on which Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the | communistmanifesto
competition with the large capitalists, partly because their | communistmanifesto
specialized skill is rendered worthless by the new methods of | communistmanifesto
production.  Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes | communistmanifesto
of the population. | communistmanifesto
The proletariat goes through various stages of development. | communistmanifesto
With its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie.  At | communistmanifesto
first the contest is carried on by individual labourers, then by | communistmanifesto
the workpeople of a factory, then by the operatives of one trade, | communistmanifesto
in one locality, against the individual bourgeois who directly | communistmanifesto
exploits them.  They direct their attacks not against the | communistmanifesto
bourgeois conditions of production, but against the instruments | communistmanifesto
of production themselves; they destroy imported wares that | communistmanifesto
compete with their labour, they smash to pieces machinery, they | communistmanifesto
set factories ablaze, they seek to restore by force the vanished | communistmanifesto
status of the workman of the Middle Ages. | communistmanifesto
At this stage the labourers still form an incoherent mass | communistmanifesto
scattered over the whole country, and broken up by their mutual | communistmanifesto
competition.  If anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies, | communistmanifesto
this is not yet the consequence of their own active union, but of | communistmanifesto
the union of the bourgeoisie, which class, in order to attain its | communistmanifesto
own political ends, is compelled to set the whole proletariat in | communistmanifesto
motion, and is moreover yet, for a time, able to do so.  At this | communistmanifesto
stage, therefore, the proletarians do not fight their enemies, | communistmanifesto
but the enemies of their enemies, the remnants of absolute | communistmanifesto
monarchy, the landowners, the non-industrial bourgeois, the petty | communistmanifesto
bourgeoisie.  Thus the whole historical movement is concentrated | communistmanifesto
in the hands of the bourgeoisie; every victory so obtained is a | communistmanifesto
victory for the bourgeoisie. | communistmanifesto
But with the development of industry the proletariat not only | communistmanifesto
increases in number; it becomes concentrated in greater masses, | communistmanifesto
its strength grows, and it feels that strength more.  The various | communistmanifesto
interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the | communistmanifesto
proletariat are more and more equalised, in proportion as | communistmanifesto
machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour, and nearly | communistmanifesto
everywhere reduces wages to the same low level.  The growing | communistmanifesto
competition among the bourgeois, and the resulting commercial | communistmanifesto
crises, make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating.  The | communistmanifesto
unceasing improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing, | communistmanifesto
makes their livelihood more and more precarious; the collisions | communistmanifesto
between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and | communistmanifesto
more the character of collisions between two classes.  Thereupon | communistmanifesto
the workers begin to form combinations (Trades Unions) against | communistmanifesto
the bourgeois; they club together in order to keep up the rate of | communistmanifesto
wages; they found permanent associations in order to make | communistmanifesto
provision beforehand for these occasional revolts.  Here and | communistmanifesto
there the contest breaks out into riots. | communistmanifesto
Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. | communistmanifesto
The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate | communistmanifesto
result, but in the ever-expanding union of the workers.  This | communistmanifesto
union is helped on by the improved means of communication that | communistmanifesto
are created by modern industry and that place the workers of | communistmanifesto
different localities in contact with one another.  It was just | communistmanifesto
this contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local | communistmanifesto
struggles, all of the same character, into one national struggle | communistmanifesto
between classes.  But every class struggle is a political | communistmanifesto
struggle.  And that union, to attain which the burghers of the | communistmanifesto
Middle Ages, with their miserable highways, required centuries, | communistmanifesto
the modern proletarians, thanks to railways, achieve in a few | communistmanifesto
years. | communistmanifesto
This organisation of the proletarians into a class, and | communistmanifesto
consequently into a political party, is continually being upset | communistmanifesto
again by the competition between the workers themselves.  But it | communistmanifesto
ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier.  It compels | communistmanifesto
legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers, | communistmanifesto
by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie | communistmanifesto
itself.  Thus the ten-hours' bill in England was carried. | communistmanifesto
Altogether collisions between the classes of the old society | communistmanifesto
further, in many ways, the course of development of the | communistmanifesto
proletariat. The bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant | communistmanifesto
battle. At first with the aristocracy; later on, with those | communistmanifesto
portions of the bourgeoisie itself, whose interests have become | communistmanifesto
antagonistic to the progress of industry; at all times, with the | communistmanifesto
bourgeoisie of foreign countries. In all these battles it sees | communistmanifesto
itself compelled to appeal to the proletariat, to ask for its | communistmanifesto
help, and thus, to drag it into the political arena. The | communistmanifesto
bourgeoisie itself, therefore, supplies the proletariat with its | communistmanifesto
own instruments of political and general education, in other | communistmanifesto
words, it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting | communistmanifesto
the bourgeoisie. | communistmanifesto
Further, as we have already seen, entire sections of the ruling | communistmanifesto
classes are, by the advance of industry, precipitated into the | communistmanifesto
proletariat, or are at least threatened in their conditions of | communistmanifesto
existence.  These also supply the proletariat with fresh elements | communistmanifesto
of enlightenment and progress. | communistmanifesto
Finally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive | communistmanifesto
hour, the process of dissolution going on within the ruling | communistmanifesto
class, in fact within the whole range of society, assumes such a | communistmanifesto
violent, glaring character, that a small section of the ruling | communistmanifesto
class cuts itself adrift, and joins the revolutionary class, the | communistmanifesto
class that holds the future in its hands.  Just as, therefore, at | communistmanifesto
an earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the | communistmanifesto
bourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the | communistmanifesto
proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois | communistmanifesto
ideologists, who have raised themselves to the level of | communistmanifesto
comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole. | communistmanifesto
Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie | communistmanifesto
today, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class. | communistmanifesto
The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of | communistmanifesto
Modern Industry; the proletariat is its special and essential | communistmanifesto
product.  The lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the | communistmanifesto
shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these fight against the | communistmanifesto
bourgeoisie, to save from extinction their existence as fractions | communistmanifesto
of the middle class.  They are therefore not revolutionary, but | communistmanifesto
conservative.  Nay more, they are reactionary, for they try | communistmanifesto
to roll back the wheel of history.  If by chance they are | communistmanifesto
revolutionary, they are so only in view of their impending | communistmanifesto
transfer into the proletariat, they thus defend not their | communistmanifesto
present, but their future interests, they desert their own | communistmanifesto
standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat. | communistmanifesto
The "dangerous class," the social scum, that passively rotting | communistmanifesto
mass thrown off by the lowest layers of old society, may, | communistmanifesto
here and there, be swept into the movement by a proletarian | communistmanifesto
revolution; its conditions of life, however, prepare it far more | communistmanifesto
for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue. | communistmanifesto
In the conditions of the proletariat, those of old society at | communistmanifesto
large are already virtually swamped.  The proletarian is without | communistmanifesto
property; his relation to his wife and children has no longer | communistmanifesto
anything in common with the bourgeois family-relations; modern | communistmanifesto
industrial labour, modern subjection to capital, the same in | communistmanifesto
England as in France, in America as in Germany, has stripped him | communistmanifesto
of every trace of national character.  Law, morality, religion, | communistmanifesto
are to him so many bourgeois prejudices, behind which lurk in | communistmanifesto
ambush just as many bourgeois interests. | communistmanifesto
All the preceding classes that got the upper hand, sought to | communistmanifesto
fortify their already acquired status by subjecting society at | communistmanifesto
large to their conditions of appropriation.  The proletarians | communistmanifesto
cannot become masters of the productive forces of society, except | communistmanifesto
by abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation, and | communistmanifesto
thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation.  They | communistmanifesto
have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify; their mission | communistmanifesto
is to destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of, | communistmanifesto
individual property. | communistmanifesto
All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, | communistmanifesto
or in the interests of minorities.  The proletarian movement is | communistmanifesto
the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, | communistmanifesto
in the interests of the immense majority.  The proletariat, the | communistmanifesto
lowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise | communistmanifesto
itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official | communistmanifesto
society being sprung into the air. | communistmanifesto
Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the | communistmanifesto
proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle. | communistmanifesto
The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all | communistmanifesto
settle matters with its own bourgeoisie. | communistmanifesto
In depicting the most general phases of the development of the | communistmanifesto
proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging | communistmanifesto
within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks | communistmanifesto
out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the | communistmanifesto
bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat. | communistmanifesto
Hitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have | communistmanifesto
already seen, on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed | communistmanifesto
classes.  But in order to oppress a class, certain conditions | communistmanifesto
must be assured to it under which it can, at least, continue its | communistmanifesto
slavish existence.  The serf, in the period of serfdom, raised | communistmanifesto
himself to membership in the commune, just as the petty | communistmanifesto
bourgeois, under the yoke of feudal absolutism, managed to | communistmanifesto
develop into a bourgeois.  The modern laborer, on the contrary, | communistmanifesto
instead of rising with the progress of industry, sinks deeper and | communistmanifesto
deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class.  He | communistmanifesto
becomes a pauper, and pauperism develops more rapidly than | communistmanifesto
population and wealth.  And here it becomes evident, that the | communistmanifesto
bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in | communistmanifesto
society, and to impose its conditions of existence upon society | communistmanifesto
as an over-riding law.  It is unfit to rule because it is | communistmanifesto
incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his | communistmanifesto
slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a | communistmanifesto
state, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him. | communistmanifesto
Society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie, in other | communistmanifesto
words, its existence is no longer compatible with society. | communistmanifesto
The essential condition for the existence, and for the sway of | communistmanifesto
the bourgeois class, is the formation and augmentation of | communistmanifesto
capital; the condition for capital is wage-labour.  Wage-labour | communistmanifesto
rests exclusively on competition between the laborers.  The | communistmanifesto
advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie, | communistmanifesto
replaces the isolation of the labourers, due to competition, | communistmanifesto
by their revolutionary combination, due to association.  The | communistmanifesto
development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its | communistmanifesto
feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and | communistmanifesto
appropriates products.  What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, | communistmanifesto
above all, is its own grave-diggers.  Its fall and the victory of | communistmanifesto
the proletariat are equally inevitable. | communistmanifesto
II.  PROLETARIANS AND COMMUNISTS | communistmanifesto
In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a | communistmanifesto
whole? | communistmanifesto
The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to other | communistmanifesto
working-class parties. | communistmanifesto
They have no interests separate and apart from those of the | communistmanifesto
proletariat as a whole. | communistmanifesto
They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, | communistmanifesto
by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement. | communistmanifesto
The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties | communistmanifesto
by this only: (1) In the national struggles of the proletarians | communistmanifesto
of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front | communistmanifesto
the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of | communistmanifesto
all nationality.  (2) In the various stages of development which the | communistmanifesto
struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass | communistmanifesto
through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the | communistmanifesto
movement as a whole. | communistmanifesto
The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, | communistmanifesto
the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class | communistmanifesto
parties of every country, that section which pushes forward | communistmanifesto
all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over | communistmanifesto
the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly | communistmanifesto
understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate | communistmanifesto
general results of the proletarian movement. | communistmanifesto
The immediate aim of the Communist is the same as that of all | communistmanifesto
the other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into | communistmanifesto
a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of | communistmanifesto
political power by the proletariat. | communistmanifesto
The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way | communistmanifesto
based on ideas or principles that have been invented, or | communistmanifesto
discovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer.  They | communistmanifesto
merely express, in general terms, actual relations springing from | communistmanifesto
an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going on | communistmanifesto
under our very eyes.  The abolition of existing property | communistmanifesto
relations is not at all a distinctive feature of Communism. | communistmanifesto
All property relations in the past have continually been subject | communistmanifesto
to historical change consequent upon the change in historical | communistmanifesto
conditions. | communistmanifesto
The French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in | communistmanifesto
favour of bourgeois property. | communistmanifesto
The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of | communistmanifesto
property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But | communistmanifesto
modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete | communistmanifesto
expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, | communistmanifesto
that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the | communistmanifesto
many by the few. | communistmanifesto
In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in | communistmanifesto
the single sentence: Abolition of private property. | communistmanifesto
We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing | communistmanifesto
the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a | communistmanifesto
man's own labour, which property is alleged to be the groundwork | communistmanifesto
of all personal freedom, activity and independence. | communistmanifesto
Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property!  Do you mean the | communistmanifesto
property of the petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of | communistmanifesto
property that preceded the bourgeois form?  There is no need to | communistmanifesto
abolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent | communistmanifesto
already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily. | communistmanifesto
Or do you mean modern bourgeois private property? | communistmanifesto
But does wage-labour create any property for the labourer?  Not | communistmanifesto
a bit.  It creates capital, i.e., that kind of property which | communistmanifesto
exploits wage-labour, and which cannot increase except upon | communistmanifesto
condition of begetting a new supply of wage-labour for fresh | communistmanifesto
exploitation.  Property, in its present form, is based on the | communistmanifesto
antagonism of capital and wage-labour.  Let us examine both sides | communistmanifesto
of this antagonism. | communistmanifesto
To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a | communistmanifesto
social status in production.  Capital is a collective product, | communistmanifesto
and only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last | communistmanifesto
resort, only by the united action of all members of society, | communistmanifesto
can it be set in motion. | communistmanifesto
Capital is, therefore, not a personal, it is a social power. | communistmanifesto
When, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into | communistmanifesto
the property of all members of society, personal property is not | communistmanifesto
thereby transformed into social property. It is only the social | communistmanifesto
character of the property that is changed. It loses its | communistmanifesto
class-character. | communistmanifesto
Let us now take wage-labour. | communistmanifesto
The average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage, i.e., | communistmanifesto
that quantum of the means of subsistence, which is absolutely | communistmanifesto
requisite in bare existence as a labourer.  What, therefore, the | communistmanifesto
wage-labourer appropriates by means of his labour, merely | communistmanifesto
suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence.  We by no | communistmanifesto
means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the | communistmanifesto
products of labour, an appropriation that is made for the | communistmanifesto
maintenance and reproduction of human life, and that leaves no | communistmanifesto
surplus wherewith to command the labour of others.  All that we | communistmanifesto
want to do away with, is the miserable character of this | communistmanifesto
appropriation, under which the labourer lives merely to increase | communistmanifesto
capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of | communistmanifesto
the ruling class requires it. | communistmanifesto
In bourgeois society, living labour is but a means to increase | communistmanifesto
accumulated labour.  In Communist society, accumulated labour | communistmanifesto
is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence | communistmanifesto
of the labourer. | communistmanifesto
In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present; | communistmanifesto
in Communist society, the present dominates the past.  In | communistmanifesto
bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, | communistmanifesto
while the living person is dependent and has no individuality. | communistmanifesto
And the abolition of this state of things is called by the | communistmanifesto
bourgeois, abolition of individuality and freedom! And rightly | communistmanifesto
so. The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois | communistmanifesto
independence, and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at. | communistmanifesto
By freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of | communistmanifesto
production, free trade, free selling and buying. | communistmanifesto
But if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying | communistmanifesto
disappears also.  This talk about free selling and buying, and | communistmanifesto
all the other "brave words" of our bourgeoisie about freedom in | communistmanifesto
general, have a meaning, if any, only in contrast with restricted | communistmanifesto
selling and buying, with the fettered traders of the Middle Ages, | communistmanifesto
but have no meaning when opposed to the Communistic abolition of | communistmanifesto
buying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions of production, | communistmanifesto
and of the bourgeoisie itself. | communistmanifesto
You are horrified at our intending to do away with private | communistmanifesto
property.  But in your existing society, private property is | communistmanifesto
already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its | communistmanifesto
existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the | communistmanifesto
hands of those nine-tenths.  You reproach us, therefore, with | communistmanifesto
intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary | communistmanifesto
condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any | communistmanifesto
property for the immense majority of society. | communistmanifesto
In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your | communistmanifesto
property.  Precisely so; that is just what we intend. | communistmanifesto
From the moment when labour can no longer be converted into | communistmanifesto
capital, money, or rent, into a social power capable of being | communistmanifesto
monopolised, i.e., from the moment when individual property can | communistmanifesto
no longer be transformed into bourgeois property, into capital, | communistmanifesto
from that moment, you say individuality vanishes. | communistmanifesto
You must, therefore, confess that by "individual" you mean no | communistmanifesto
other person than the bourgeois, than the middle-class owner of | communistmanifesto
property.  This person must, indeed, be swept out of the way, and | communistmanifesto
made impossible. | communistmanifesto
Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the | communistmanifesto
products of society; all that it does is to deprive him of the | communistmanifesto
power to subjugate the labour of others by means of such | communistmanifesto
appropriation. | communistmanifesto
It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property | communistmanifesto
all work will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us. | communistmanifesto
According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone | communistmanifesto
to the dogs through sheer idleness; for those of its members who | communistmanifesto
work, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything, do not | communistmanifesto
work. The whole of this objection is but another expression of | communistmanifesto
the tautology: that there can no longer be any wage-labour when | communistmanifesto
there is no longer any capital. | communistmanifesto
All objections urged against the Communistic mode of producing | communistmanifesto
and appropriating material products, have, in the same way, | communistmanifesto
been urged against the Communistic modes of producing and | communistmanifesto
appropriating intellectual products.  Just as, to the bourgeois, | communistmanifesto
the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of | communistmanifesto
production itself, so the disappearance of class culture is to | communistmanifesto
him identical with the disappearance of all culture. | communistmanifesto
That culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous | communistmanifesto
majority, a mere training to act as a machine. | communistmanifesto
But don't wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended | communistmanifesto
abolition of bourgeois property, the standard of your bourgeois | communistmanifesto
notions of freedom, culture, law, etc.  Your very ideas are but | communistmanifesto
the outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and | communistmanifesto
bourgeois property, just as your jurisprudence is but the will of | communistmanifesto
your class made into a law for all, a will, whose essential | communistmanifesto
character and direction are determined by the economical | communistmanifesto
conditions of existence of your class. | communistmanifesto
The selfish misconception that induces you to transform into | communistmanifesto
eternal laws of nature and of reason, the social forms | communistmanifesto
springing from your present mode of production and form of | communistmanifesto
property--historical relations that rise and disappear in the | communistmanifesto
progress of production--this misconception you share with every | communistmanifesto
ruling class that has preceded you.  What you see clearly in the | communistmanifesto
case of ancient property, what you admit in the case of feudal | communistmanifesto
property, you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of | communistmanifesto
your own bourgeois form of property. | communistmanifesto
Abolition of the family!  Even the most radical flare up at this | communistmanifesto
infamous proposal of the Communists. | communistmanifesto
On what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family, | communistmanifesto
based?  On capital, on private gain.  In its completely developed | communistmanifesto
form this family exists only among the bourgeoisie.  But this | communistmanifesto
state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of | communistmanifesto
the family among the proletarians, and in public prostitution. | communistmanifesto
The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its | communistmanifesto
complement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of | communistmanifesto
capital. | communistmanifesto
Do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of | communistmanifesto
children by their parents?  To this crime we plead guilty. | communistmanifesto
But, you will say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations, | communistmanifesto
when we replace home education by social. | communistmanifesto
And your education!  Is not that also social, and determined by the | communistmanifesto
social conditions under which you educate, by the intervention, | communistmanifesto
direct or indirect, of society, by means of schools, etc.?  The | communistmanifesto
Communists have not invented the intervention of society in | communistmanifesto
education; they do but seek to alter the character of that | communistmanifesto
intervention, and to rescue education from the influence of the | communistmanifesto
ruling class. | communistmanifesto
The bourgeois clap-trap about the family and education, about | communistmanifesto
the hallowed co-relation of parent and child, becomes all the | communistmanifesto
more disgusting, the more, by the action of Modern Industry, all | communistmanifesto
family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder, and their | communistmanifesto
children transformed into simple articles of commerce and | communistmanifesto
instruments of labour. | communistmanifesto
But you Communists would introduce community of women, screams | communistmanifesto
the whole bourgeoisie in chorus. | communistmanifesto
The bourgeois sees in his wife a mere instrument of production. | communistmanifesto
He hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited | communistmanifesto
in common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion than | communistmanifesto
that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the | communistmanifesto
women. | communistmanifesto
He has not even a suspicion that the real point is to do away | communistmanifesto
with the status of women as mere instruments of production. | communistmanifesto
For the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the | communistmanifesto
virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women | communistmanifesto
which, they pretend, is to be openly and officially established | communistmanifesto
by the Communists.  The Communists have no need to introduce | communistmanifesto
community of women; it has existed almost from time immemorial. | communistmanifesto
Our bourgeois, not content with having the wives and daughters | communistmanifesto
of their proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common | communistmanifesto
prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other's | communistmanifesto
wives. | communistmanifesto
Bourgeois marriage is in reality a system of wives in common | communistmanifesto
and thus, at the most, what the Communists might possibly | communistmanifesto
be reproached with, is that they desire to introduce, in | communistmanifesto
substitution for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalised | communistmanifesto
community of women. For the rest, it is self-evident that the | communistmanifesto
abolition of the present system of production must bring with it | communistmanifesto
the abolition of the community of women springing from that | communistmanifesto
system, i.e., of prostitution both public and private. | communistmanifesto
The Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish | communistmanifesto
countries and nationality. | communistmanifesto
The working men have no country.  We cannot take from them what | communistmanifesto
they have not got.  Since the proletariat must first of all | communistmanifesto
acquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of | communistmanifesto
the nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is, so far, | communistmanifesto
itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word. | communistmanifesto
National differences and antagonisms between peoples are daily | communistmanifesto
more and more vanishing, owing to the development of the | communistmanifesto
bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world-market, to | communistmanifesto
uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of | communistmanifesto
life corresponding thereto. | communistmanifesto
The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still | communistmanifesto
faster. United action, of the leading civilised countries at | communistmanifesto
least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of | communistmanifesto
the proletariat. | communistmanifesto
In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another | communistmanifesto
is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will | communistmanifesto
also be put an end to.  In proportion as the antagonism between | communistmanifesto
classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation | communistmanifesto
to another will come to an end. | communistmanifesto
The charges against Communism made from a religious, a | communistmanifesto
philosophical, and, generally, from an ideological standpoint, | communistmanifesto
are not deserving of serious examination. | communistmanifesto
Does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man's ideas, | communistmanifesto
views and conceptions, in one word, man's consciousness, changes | communistmanifesto
with every change in the conditions of his material existence, in | communistmanifesto
his social relations and in his social life? | communistmanifesto
What else does the history of ideas prove, than that | communistmanifesto
intellectual production changes its character in proportion as | communistmanifesto
material production is changed? The ruling ideas of each age | communistmanifesto
have ever been the ideas of its ruling class. | communistmanifesto
When people speak of ideas that revolutionise society, they do | communistmanifesto
but express the fact, that within the old society, the elements | communistmanifesto
of a new one have been created, and that the dissolution of the | communistmanifesto
old ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old | communistmanifesto
conditions of existence. | communistmanifesto
When the ancient world was in its last throes, the ancient | communistmanifesto
religions were overcome by Christianity.  When Christian ideas | communistmanifesto
succumbed in the 18th century to rationalist ideas, feudal | communistmanifesto
society fought its death battle with the then revolutionary | communistmanifesto
bourgeoisie.  The ideas of religious liberty and freedom of | communistmanifesto
conscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition | communistmanifesto
within the domain of knowledge. | communistmanifesto
"Undoubtedly," it will be said, "religious, moral, philosophical | communistmanifesto
and juridical ideas have been modified in the course of | communistmanifesto
historical development.  But religion, morality philosophy, | communistmanifesto
political science, and law, constantly survived this change." | communistmanifesto
"There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice, | communistmanifesto
etc. that are common to all states of society. But Communism | communistmanifesto
abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all | communistmanifesto
morality, instead of constituting them on a new basis; it | communistmanifesto
therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience." | communistmanifesto
What does this accusation reduce itself to?  The history of | communistmanifesto
all past society has consisted in the development of class | communistmanifesto
antagonisms, antagonisms that assumed different forms at | communistmanifesto
different epochs. | communistmanifesto
But whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to all | communistmanifesto
past ages, viz., the exploitation of one part of society by the | communistmanifesto
other. No wonder, then, that the social consciousness of past | communistmanifesto
ages, despite all the multiplicity and variety it displays, | communistmanifesto
moves within certain common forms, or general ideas, which | communistmanifesto
cannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance of | communistmanifesto
class antagonisms. | communistmanifesto
The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with | communistmanifesto
traditional property relations; no wonder that its development | communistmanifesto
involves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas. | communistmanifesto
But let us have done with the bourgeois objections to Communism. | communistmanifesto
We have seen above, that the first step in the revolution by the | communistmanifesto
working class, is to raise the proletariat to the position of | communistmanifesto
ruling as to win the battle of democracy. | communistmanifesto
The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by | communistmanifesto
degrees, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all | communistmanifesto
instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the | communistmanifesto
proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the | communistmanifesto
total of productive forces as rapidly as possible. | communistmanifesto
Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by | communistmanifesto
means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on | communistmanifesto
the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, | communistmanifesto
therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, | communistmanifesto
but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, | communistmanifesto
necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are | communistmanifesto
unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of | communistmanifesto
production. | communistmanifesto
These measures will of course be different in different | communistmanifesto
countries. | communistmanifesto
Nevertheless in the most advanced countries, the following will | communistmanifesto
be pretty generally applicable. | communistmanifesto
1.  Abolition of property in land and application of all rents | communistmanifesto
    of land to public purposes. | communistmanifesto
2.  A heavy progressive or graduated income tax. | communistmanifesto
3.  Abolition of all right of inheritance. | communistmanifesto
4.  Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels. | communistmanifesto
5.  Centralisation of credit in the hands of the State, by means | communistmanifesto
    of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive | communistmanifesto
    monopoly. | communistmanifesto
6.  Centralisation of the means of communication and transport | communistmanifesto
    in the hands of the State. | communistmanifesto
7.  Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by | communistmanifesto
    the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and | communistmanifesto
    the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a | communistmanifesto
    common plan. | communistmanifesto
8.  Equal liability of all to labour.  Establishment of | communistmanifesto
    industrial armies, especially for agriculture. | communistmanifesto
9.  Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; | communistmanifesto
    gradual abolition of the distinction between town and | communistmanifesto
    country, by a more equable distribution of the population | communistmanifesto
    over the country. | communistmanifesto
10. Free education for all children in public schools. | communistmanifesto
    Abolition of children's factory labour in its present form. | communistmanifesto
    Combination of education with industrial production, &c., &c. | communistmanifesto
When, in the course of development, class distinctions have | communistmanifesto
disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the | communistmanifesto
hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power | communistmanifesto
will lose its political character.  Political power, properly so | communistmanifesto
called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing | communistmanifesto
another.  If the proletariat during its contest with the | communistmanifesto
bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to | communistmanifesto
organise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it | communistmanifesto
makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force | communistmanifesto
the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these | communistmanifesto
conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of | communistmanifesto
class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have | communistmanifesto
abolished its own supremacy as a class. | communistmanifesto
In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and | communistmanifesto
class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which | communistmanifesto
the free development of each is the condition for the free | communistmanifesto
development of all. | communistmanifesto
III.  SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST LITERATURE | communistmanifesto
1. REACTIONARY SOCIALISM | communistmanifesto
A. Feudal Socialism | communistmanifesto
Owing to their historical position, it became the vocation of the | communistmanifesto
aristocracies of France and England to write pamphlets against | communistmanifesto
modern bourgeois society.  In the French revolution of July 1830, | communistmanifesto
and in the English reform agitation, these aristocracies again | communistmanifesto
succumbed to the hateful upstart.  Thenceforth, a serious political | communistmanifesto
contest was altogether out of the question.  A literary battle | communistmanifesto
alone remained possible.  But even in the domain of literature | communistmanifesto
the old cries of the restoration period had become impossible. | communistmanifesto
In order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy were obliged to | communistmanifesto
lose sight, apparently, of their own interests, and to formulate | communistmanifesto
their indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the | communistmanifesto
exploited working class alone.  Thus the aristocracy took their | communistmanifesto
revenge by singing lampoons on their new master, and whispering | communistmanifesto
in his ears sinister prophecies of coming catastrophe. | communistmanifesto
In this way arose Feudal Socialism: half lamentation, half | communistmanifesto
lampoon; half echo of the past, half menace of the future; at | communistmanifesto
times, by its bitter, witty and incisive criticism, striking the | communistmanifesto
bourgeoisie to the very heart's core; but always ludicrous in | communistmanifesto
its effect, through total incapacity to comprehend the march of | communistmanifesto
modern history. | communistmanifesto
The aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them, waved the | communistmanifesto
proletarian alms-bag in front for a banner.  But the people, so | communistmanifesto
often as it joined them, saw on their hindquarters the old feudal | communistmanifesto
coats of arms, and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter. | communistmanifesto
One section of the French Legitimists and "Young England" | communistmanifesto
exhibited this spectacle. | communistmanifesto
In pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to | communistmanifesto
that of the bourgeoisie, the feudalists forget that they | communistmanifesto
exploited under circumstances and conditions that were quite | communistmanifesto
different, and that are now antiquated.  In showing that, under | communistmanifesto
their rule, the modern proletariat never existed, they forget | communistmanifesto
that the modern bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their | communistmanifesto
own form of society. | communistmanifesto
For the rest, so little do they conceal the reactionary | communistmanifesto
character of their criticism that their chief accusation against | communistmanifesto
the bourgeoisie amounts to this, that under the bourgeois regime | communistmanifesto
a class is being developed, which is destined to cut up root and | communistmanifesto
branch the old order of society. | communistmanifesto
What they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it | communistmanifesto
creates a proletariat, as that it creates a revolutionary | communistmanifesto
proletariat. | communistmanifesto
In political practice, therefore, they join in all coercive | communistmanifesto
measures against the working class; and in ordinary life, | communistmanifesto
despite their high falutin phrases, they stoop to pick up the | communistmanifesto
golden apples dropped from the tree of industry, and to barter | communistmanifesto
truth, love, and honour for traffic in wool, beetroot-sugar, and | communistmanifesto
potato spirits. | communistmanifesto
As the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord, | communistmanifesto
so has Clerical Socialism with Feudal Socialism. | communistmanifesto
Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist | communistmanifesto
tinge. Has not Christianity declaimed against private property, | communistmanifesto
against marriage, against the State? Has it not preached in the | communistmanifesto
place of these, charity and poverty, celibacy and mortification | communistmanifesto
of the flesh, monastic life and Mother Church? Christian | communistmanifesto
Socialism is but the holy, water with which the priest consecrates | communistmanifesto
the heart-burnings of the aristocrat. | communistmanifesto
B. Petty-Bourgeois Socialism | communistmanifesto
The feudal aristocracy was not the only class that was ruined by | communistmanifesto
the bourgeoisie, not the only class whose conditions of existence | communistmanifesto
pined and perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois society. | communistmanifesto
The mediaeval burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were | communistmanifesto
the precursors of the modern bourgeoisie.  In those countries | communistmanifesto
which are but little developed, industrially and commercially, | communistmanifesto
these two classes still vegetate side by side with the rising | communistmanifesto
bourgeoisie. | communistmanifesto
In countries where modern civilisation has become fully | communistmanifesto
developed, a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed, | communistmanifesto
fluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie and ever renewing | communistmanifesto
itself as a supplementary part of bourgeois society.  The | communistmanifesto
individual members of this class, however, are being constantly | communistmanifesto
hurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition, | communistmanifesto
and, as modern industry develops, they even see the moment | communistmanifesto
approaching when they will completely disappear as an independent | communistmanifesto
section of modern society, to be replaced, in manufactures, | communistmanifesto
agriculture and commerce, by overlookers, bailiffs and shopmen. | communistmanifesto
In countries like France, where the peasants constitute far more | communistmanifesto
than half of the population, it was natural that writers who | communistmanifesto
sided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, should use, | communistmanifesto
in their criticism of the bourgeois regime, the standard of the | communistmanifesto
peasant and petty bourgeois, and from the standpoint of these | communistmanifesto
intermediate classes should take up the cudgels for the working | communistmanifesto
class.  Thus arose petty-bourgeois Socialism.  Sismondi was the | communistmanifesto
head of this school, not only in France but also in England. | communistmanifesto
This school of Socialism dissected with great acuteness the | communistmanifesto
contradictions in the conditions of modern production.  It laid | communistmanifesto
bare the hypocritical apologies of economists.  It proved, | communistmanifesto
incontrovertibly, the disastrous effects of machinery and | communistmanifesto
division of labour; the concentration of capital and land in a | communistmanifesto
few hands; overproduction and crises; it pointed out the | communistmanifesto
inevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and peasant, the misery | communistmanifesto
of the proletariat, the anarchy in production, the crying | communistmanifesto
inequalities in the distribution of wealth, the industrial war of | communistmanifesto
extermination between nations, the dissolution of old moral | communistmanifesto
bonds, of the old family relations, of the old nationalities. | communistmanifesto
In its positive aims, however, this form of Socialism aspires | communistmanifesto
either to restoring the old means of production and of exchange, | communistmanifesto
and with them the old property relations, and the old society, or | communistmanifesto
to cramping the modern means of production and of exchange, | communistmanifesto
within the framework of the old property relations that have | communistmanifesto
been, and were bound to be, exploded by those means.  In either | communistmanifesto
case, it is both reactionary and Utopian. | communistmanifesto
Its last words are: corporate guilds for manufacture, | communistmanifesto
patriarchal relations in agriculture. | communistmanifesto
Ultimately, when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all | communistmanifesto
intoxicating effects of self-deception, this form of Socialism | communistmanifesto
ended in a miserable fit of the blues. | communistmanifesto
C. German, or "True," Socialism | communistmanifesto
The Socialist and Communist literature of France, a literature | communistmanifesto
that originated under the pressure of a bourgeoisie in power, and | communistmanifesto
that was the expression of the struggle against this power, was | communistmanifesto
introduced into Germany at a time when the bourgeoisie, in that | communistmanifesto
country, had just begun its contest with feudal absolutism. | communistmanifesto
German philosophers, would-be philosophers, and beaux esprits, | communistmanifesto
eagerly seized on this literature, only forgetting, that when | communistmanifesto
these writings immigrated from France into Germany, French social | communistmanifesto
conditions had not immigrated along with them.  In contact with | communistmanifesto
German social conditions, this French literature lost all its | communistmanifesto
immediate practical significance, and assumed a purely literary | communistmanifesto
aspect.  Thus, to the German philosophers of the eighteenth | communistmanifesto
century, the demands of the first French Revolution were nothing | communistmanifesto
more than the demands of "Practical Reason" in general, and the | communistmanifesto
utterance of the will of the revolutionary French bourgeoisie | communistmanifesto
signified in their eyes the law of pure Will, of Will as it was | communistmanifesto
bound to be, of true human Will generally. | communistmanifesto
The world of the German literate consisted solely in bringing | communistmanifesto
the new French ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical | communistmanifesto
conscience, or rather, in annexing the French ideas without | communistmanifesto
deserting their own philosophic point of view. | communistmanifesto
This annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign | communistmanifesto
language is appropriated, namely, by translation. | communistmanifesto
It is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of Catholic | communistmanifesto
Saints over the manuscripts on which the classical works of | communistmanifesto
ancient heathendom had been written.  The German literate | communistmanifesto
reversed this process with the profane French literature.  They | communistmanifesto
wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the French original. | communistmanifesto
For instance, beneath the French criticism of the economic | communistmanifesto
functions of money, they wrote "Alienation of Humanity," and | communistmanifesto
beneath the French criticism of the bourgeois State they wrote | communistmanifesto
"dethronement of the Category of the General," and so forth. | communistmanifesto
The introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of | communistmanifesto
the French historical criticisms they dubbed "Philosophy of | communistmanifesto
Action," "True Socialism," "German Science of Socialism," | communistmanifesto
"Philosophical Foundation of Socialism," and so on. | communistmanifesto
The French Socialist and Communist literature was thus completely | communistmanifesto
emasculated. And, since it ceased in the hands of the German to express | communistmanifesto
the struggle of one class with the other, he felt conscious of having | communistmanifesto
overcome "French one-sidedness" and of representing, not true | communistmanifesto
requirements, but the requirements of truth; not the interests of the | communistmanifesto
proletariat, but the interests of Human Nature, of Man in general, who | communistmanifesto
belongs to no class, has no reality, who exists only in the misty realm | communistmanifesto
of philosophical fantasy. | communistmanifesto
This German Socialism, which took its schoolboy task so seriously | communistmanifesto
and solemnly, and extolled its poor stock-in-trade in such | communistmanifesto
mountebank fashion, meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic | communistmanifesto
innocence. | communistmanifesto
The fight of the German, and especially, of the Prussian bourgeoisie, | communistmanifesto
against feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy, in other words, the | communistmanifesto
liberal movement, became more earnest. | communistmanifesto
                  [_As given in the original edition_.] | gulliverstravels
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient and | gulliverstravels
intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us on the | gulliverstravels
mother’s side.  About three years ago, Mr. Gulliver growing weary of the | gulliverstravels
concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff, made a | gulliverstravels
small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark, in | gulliverstravels
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet in | gulliverstravels
good esteem among his neighbours. | gulliverstravels
Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his father | gulliverstravels
dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from Oxfordshire; to | gulliverstravels
confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at Banbury in that | gulliverstravels
county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers. | gulliverstravels
Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following papers in | gulliverstravels
my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should think fit.  I | gulliverstravels
have carefully perused them three times.  The style is very plain and | gulliverstravels
simple; and the only fault I find is, that the author, after the manner | gulliverstravels
of travellers, is a little too circumstantial.  There is an air of truth | gulliverstravels
apparent through the whole; and indeed the author was so distinguished | gulliverstravels
for his veracity, that it became a sort of proverb among his neighbours | gulliverstravels
at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing, to say, it was as true as if | gulliverstravels
Mr. Gulliver had spoken it. | gulliverstravels
By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the author’s | gulliverstravels
permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to send them into | gulliverstravels
the world, hoping they may be, at least for some time, a better | gulliverstravels
entertainment to our young noblemen, than the common scribbles of | gulliverstravels
politics and party. | gulliverstravels
This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not made | gulliverstravels
bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and tides, | gulliverstravels
as well as to the variations and bearings in the several voyages, | gulliverstravels
together with the minute descriptions of the management of the ship in | gulliverstravels
storms, in the style of sailors; likewise the account of longitudes and | gulliverstravels
latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend, that Mr. Gulliver may be a | gulliverstravels
little dissatisfied.  But I was resolved to fit the work as much as | gulliverstravels
possible to the general capacity of readers.  However, if my own | gulliverstravels
ignorance in sea affairs shall have led me to commit some mistakes, I | gulliverstravels
alone am answerable for them.  And if any traveller hath a curiosity to | gulliverstravels
see the whole work at large, as it came from the hands of the author, I | gulliverstravels
will be ready to gratify him. | gulliverstravels
As for any further particulars relating to the author, the reader will | gulliverstravels
receive satisfaction from the first pages of the book. | gulliverstravels
                                                          RICHARD SYMPSON. | gulliverstravels
A LETTER FROM CAPTAIN GULLIVER TO HIS COUSIN SYMPSON. | gulliverstravels
                        WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1727. | gulliverstravels
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be called to | gulliverstravels
it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on me to | gulliverstravels
publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels, with directions | gulliverstravels
to hire some young gentleman of either university to put them in order, | gulliverstravels
and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did, by my advice, in his | gulliverstravels
book called “A Voyage round the world.”  But I do not remember I gave you | gulliverstravels
power to consent that any thing should be omitted, and much less that any | gulliverstravels
thing should be inserted; therefore, as to the latter, I do here renounce | gulliverstravels
every thing of that kind; particularly a paragraph about her majesty | gulliverstravels
Queen Anne, of most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence | gulliverstravels
and esteem her more than any of human species.  But you, or your | gulliverstravels
interpolator, ought to have considered, that it was not my inclination, | gulliverstravels
so was it not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my | gulliverstravels
master _Houyhnhnm_: And besides, the fact was altogether false; for to my | gulliverstravels
knowledge, being in England during some part of her majesty’s reign, she | gulliverstravels
did govern by a chief minister; nay even by two successively, the first | gulliverstravels
whereof was the lord of Godolphin, and the second the lord of Oxford; so | gulliverstravels
that you have made me say the thing that was not.  Likewise in the | gulliverstravels
account of the academy of projectors, and several passages of my | gulliverstravels
discourse to my master _Houyhnhnm_, you have either omitted some material | gulliverstravels
circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner, that I do | gulliverstravels
hardly know my own work.  When I formerly hinted to you something of this | gulliverstravels
in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you were afraid of giving | gulliverstravels
offence; that people in power were very watchful over the press, and apt | gulliverstravels
not only to interpret, but to punish every thing which looked like an | gulliverstravels
_innuendo_ (as I think you call it).  But, pray how could that which I | gulliverstravels
spoke so many years ago, and at about five thousand leagues distance, in | gulliverstravels
another reign, be applied to any of the _Yahoos_, who now are said to | gulliverstravels
govern the herd; especially at a time when I little thought, or feared, | gulliverstravels
the unhappiness of living under them?  Have not I the most reason to | gulliverstravels
complain, when I see these very _Yahoos_ carried by _Houyhnhnms_ in a | gulliverstravels
vehicle, as if they were brutes, and those the rational creatures?  And | gulliverstravels
indeed to avoid so monstrous and detestable a sight was one principal | gulliverstravels
motive of my retirement hither. | gulliverstravels
Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself, and to | gulliverstravels
the trust I reposed in you. | gulliverstravels
I do, in the next place, complain of my own great want of judgment, in | gulliverstravels
being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasoning of you and | gulliverstravels
some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my travels to be | gulliverstravels
published.  Pray bring to your mind how often I desired you to consider, | gulliverstravels
when you insisted on the motive of public good, that the _Yahoos_ were a | gulliverstravels
species of animals utterly incapable of amendment by precept or example: | gulliverstravels
and so it has proved; for, instead of seeing a full stop put to all | gulliverstravels
abuses and corruptions, at least in this little island, as I had reason | gulliverstravels
to expect; behold, after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my | gulliverstravels
book has produced one single effect according to my intentions.  I | gulliverstravels
desired you would let me know, by a letter, when party and faction were | gulliverstravels
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and modest, | gulliverstravels
with some tincture of common sense, and Smithfield blazing with pyramids | gulliverstravels
of law books; the young nobility’s education entirely changed; the | gulliverstravels
physicians banished; the female _Yahoos_ abounding in virtue, honour, | gulliverstravels
truth, and good sense; courts and levees of great ministers thoroughly | gulliverstravels
weeded and swept; wit, merit, and learning rewarded; all disgracers of | gulliverstravels
the press in prose and verse condemned to eat nothing but their own | gulliverstravels
cotton, and quench their thirst with their own ink.  These, and a | gulliverstravels
thousand other reformations, I firmly counted upon by your encouragement; | gulliverstravels
as indeed they were plainly deducible from the precepts delivered in my | gulliverstravels
book.  And it must be owned, that seven months were a sufficient time to | gulliverstravels
correct every vice and folly to which _Yahoos_ are subject, if their | gulliverstravels
natures had been capable of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom. | gulliverstravels
Yet, so far have you been from answering my expectation in any of your | gulliverstravels
letters; that on the contrary you are loading our carrier every week with | gulliverstravels
libels, and keys, and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein | gulliverstravels
I see myself accused of reflecting upon great state folk; of degrading | gulliverstravels
human nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of | gulliverstravels
abusing the female sex.  I find likewise that the writers of those | gulliverstravels
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not allow | gulliverstravels
me to be the author of my own travels; and others make me author of books | gulliverstravels
to which I am wholly a stranger. | gulliverstravels
I find likewise that your printer has been so careless as to confound the | gulliverstravels
times, and mistake the dates, of my several voyages and returns; neither | gulliverstravels
assigning the true year, nor the true month, nor day of the month: and I | gulliverstravels
hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since the publication of my | gulliverstravels
book; neither have I any copy left: however, I have sent you some | gulliverstravels
corrections, which you may insert, if ever there should be a second | gulliverstravels
edition: and yet I cannot stand to them; but shall leave that matter to | gulliverstravels
my judicious and candid readers to adjust it as they please. | gulliverstravels
I hear some of our sea _Yahoos_ find fault with my sea-language, as not | gulliverstravels
proper in many parts, nor now in use.  I cannot help it.  In my first | gulliverstravels
voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest mariners, and | gulliverstravels
learned to speak as they did.  But I have since found that the sea | gulliverstravels
_Yahoos_ are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled in their | gulliverstravels
words, which the latter change every year; insomuch, as I remember upon | gulliverstravels
each return to my own country their old dialect was so altered, that I | gulliverstravels
could hardly understand the new.  And I observe, when any _Yahoo_ comes | gulliverstravels
from London out of curiosity to visit me at my house, we neither of us | gulliverstravels
are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner intelligible to the | gulliverstravels
other. | gulliverstravels
If the censure of the _Yahoos_ could any way affect me, I should have | gulliverstravels
great reason to complain, that some of them are so bold as to think my | gulliverstravels
book of travels a mere fiction out of mine own brain, and have gone so | gulliverstravels
far as to drop hints, that the _Houyhnhnms_ and _Yahoos_ have no more | gulliverstravels
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia. | gulliverstravels
Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of _Lilliput_, _Brobdingrag_ | gulliverstravels
(for so the word should have been spelt, and not erroneously | gulliverstravels
_Brobdingnag_), and _Laputa_, I have never yet heard of any _Yahoo_ so | gulliverstravels
presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have related | gulliverstravels
concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every reader with | gulliverstravels
conviction.  And is there less probability in my account of the | gulliverstravels
_Houyhnhnms_ or _Yahoos_, when it is manifest as to the latter, there are | gulliverstravels
so many thousands even in this country, who only differ from their | gulliverstravels
brother brutes in _Houyhnhnmland_, because they use a sort of jabber, and | gulliverstravels
do not go naked?  I wrote for their amendment, and not their approbation. | gulliverstravels
The united praise of the whole race would be of less consequence to me, | gulliverstravels
than the neighing of those two degenerate _Houyhnhnms_ I keep in my | gulliverstravels
stable; because from these, degenerate as they are, I still improve in | gulliverstravels
some virtues without any mixture of vice. | gulliverstravels
Do these miserable animals presume to think, that I am so degenerated as | gulliverstravels
to defend my veracity?  _Yahoo_ as I am, it is well known through all | gulliverstravels
_Houyhnhnmland_, that, by the instructions and example of my illustrious | gulliverstravels
master, I was able in the compass of two years (although I confess with | gulliverstravels
the utmost difficulty) to remove that infernal habit of lying, shuffling, | gulliverstravels
deceiving, and equivocating, so deeply rooted in the very souls of all my | gulliverstravels
species; especially the Europeans. | gulliverstravels
I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but I | gulliverstravels
forbear troubling myself or you any further.  I must freely confess, that | gulliverstravels
since my last return, some corruptions of my _Yahoo_ nature have revived | gulliverstravels
in me by conversing with a few of your species, and particularly those of | gulliverstravels
my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else I should never have | gulliverstravels
attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming the _Yahoo_ race in | gulliverstravels
this kingdom: But I have now done with all such visionary schemes for | gulliverstravels
ever. | gulliverstravels
_April_ 2, 1727 | gulliverstravels
PART I.  A VOYAGE TO LILLIPUT. | gulliverstravels
CHAPTER I. | gulliverstravels
The author gives some account of himself and family.  His first | gulliverstravels
inducements to travel.  He is shipwrecked, and swims for his life.  Gets | gulliverstravels
safe on shore in the country of Lilliput; is made a prisoner, and carried | gulliverstravels
up the country. | gulliverstravels
My father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire: I was the third of five | gulliverstravels
sons.  He sent me to Emanuel College in Cambridge at fourteen years old, | gulliverstravels
where I resided three years, and applied myself close to my studies; but | gulliverstravels
the charge of maintaining me, although I had a very scanty allowance, | gulliverstravels
being too great for a narrow fortune, I was bound apprentice to Mr. James | gulliverstravels
Bates, an eminent surgeon in London, with whom I continued four years. | gulliverstravels
My father now and then sending me small sums of money, I laid them out in | gulliverstravels
learning navigation, and other parts of the mathematics, useful to those | gulliverstravels
who intend to travel, as I always believed it would be, some time or | gulliverstravels
other, my fortune to do.  When I left Mr. Bates, I went down to my | gulliverstravels
father: where, by the assistance of him and my uncle John, and some other | gulliverstravels
relations, I got forty pounds, and a promise of thirty pounds a year to | gulliverstravels
maintain me at Leyden: there I studied physic two years and seven months, | gulliverstravels
knowing it would be useful in long voyages. | gulliverstravels
Soon after my return from Leyden, I was recommended by my good master, | gulliverstravels
Mr. Bates, to be surgeon to the Swallow, Captain Abraham Pannel, | gulliverstravels
commander; with whom I continued three years and a half, making a voyage | gulliverstravels
or two into the Levant, and some other parts.  When I came back I | gulliverstravels
resolved to settle in London; to which Mr. Bates, my master, encouraged | gulliverstravels
me, and by him I was recommended to several patients.  I took part of a | gulliverstravels
small house in the Old Jewry; and being advised to alter my condition, I | gulliverstravels
married Mrs. Mary Burton, second daughter to Mr. Edmund Burton, hosier, | gulliverstravels
in Newgate-street, with whom I received four hundred pounds for a | gulliverstravels
portion. | gulliverstravels
But my good master Bates dying in two years after, and I having few | gulliverstravels
friends, my business began to fail; for my conscience would not suffer me | gulliverstravels
to imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren.  Having | gulliverstravels
therefore consulted with my wife, and some of my acquaintance, I | gulliverstravels
determined to go again to sea.  I was surgeon successively in two ships, | gulliverstravels
and made several voyages, for six years, to the East and West Indies, by | gulliverstravels
which I got some addition to my fortune.  My hours of leisure I spent in | gulliverstravels
reading the best authors, ancient and modern, being always provided with | gulliverstravels
a good number of books; and when I was ashore, in observing the manners | gulliverstravels
and dispositions of the people, as well as learning their language; | gulliverstravels
wherein I had a great facility, by the strength of my memory. | gulliverstravels
The last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, I grew weary of the | gulliverstravels
sea, and intended to stay at home with my wife and family.  I removed | gulliverstravels
from the Old Jewry to Fetter Lane, and from thence to Wapping, hoping to | gulliverstravels
get business among the sailors; but it would not turn to account.  After | gulliverstravels
three years expectation that things would mend, I accepted an | gulliverstravels
advantageous offer from Captain William Prichard, master of the Antelope, | gulliverstravels
who was making a voyage to the South Sea.  We set sail from Bristol, May | gulliverstravels
4, 1699, and our voyage was at first very prosperous. | gulliverstravels
It would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the reader with the | gulliverstravels
particulars of our adventures in those seas; let it suffice to inform | gulliverstravels
him, that in our passage from thence to the East Indies, we were driven | gulliverstravels
by a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen’s Land.  By an | gulliverstravels
observation, we found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees 2 minutes | gulliverstravels
south.  Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labour and ill food; | gulliverstravels
the rest were in a very weak condition.  On the 5th of November, which | gulliverstravels
was the beginning of summer in those parts, the weather being very hazy, | gulliverstravels
the seamen spied a rock within half a cable’s length of the ship; but the | gulliverstravels
wind was so strong, that we were driven directly upon it, and immediately | gulliverstravels
split.  Six of the crew, of whom I was one, having let down the boat into | gulliverstravels
the sea, made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock.  We rowed, | gulliverstravels
by my computation, about three leagues, till we were able to work no | gulliverstravels
longer, being already spent with labour while we were in the ship.  We | gulliverstravels
therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves, and in about half | gulliverstravels
an hour the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north.  What | gulliverstravels
became of my companions in the boat, as well as of those who escaped on | gulliverstravels
the rock, or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they | gulliverstravels
were all lost.  For my own part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was | gulliverstravels
pushed forward by wind and tide.  I often let my legs drop, and could | gulliverstravels
feel no bottom; but when I was almost gone, and able to struggle no | gulliverstravels
longer, I found myself within my depth; and by this time the storm was | gulliverstravels
much abated.  The declivity was so small, that I walked near a mile | gulliverstravels
before I got to the shore, which I conjectured was about eight o’clock in | gulliverstravels
the evening.  I then advanced forward near half a mile, but could not | gulliverstravels
discover any sign of houses or inhabitants; at least I was in so weak a | gulliverstravels
condition, that I did not observe them.  I was extremely tired, and with | gulliverstravels
that, and the heat of the weather, and about half a pint of brandy that I | gulliverstravels
drank as I left the ship, I found myself much inclined to sleep.  I lay | gulliverstravels
down on the grass, which was very short and soft, where I slept sounder | gulliverstravels
than ever I remembered to have done in my life, and, as I reckoned, about | gulliverstravels
nine hours; for when I awaked, it was just day-light.  I attempted to | gulliverstravels
rise, but was not able to stir: for, as I happened to lie on my back, I | gulliverstravels
found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground; | gulliverstravels
and my hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the same manner.  I | gulliverstravels
likewise felt several slender ligatures across my body, from my arm-pits | gulliverstravels
to my thighs.  I could only look upwards; the sun began to grow hot, and | gulliverstravels
the light offended my eyes.  I heard a confused noise about me; but in | gulliverstravels
the posture I lay, could see nothing except the sky.  In a little time I | gulliverstravels
felt something alive moving on my left leg, which advancing gently | gulliverstravels
forward over my breast, came almost up to my chin; when, bending my eyes | gulliverstravels
downwards as much as I could, I perceived it to be a human creature not | gulliverstravels
six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his | gulliverstravels
back.  In the mean time, I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as | gulliverstravels
I conjectured) following the first.  I was in the utmost astonishment, | gulliverstravels
and roared so loud, that they all ran back in a fright; and some of them, | gulliverstravels
as I was afterwards told, were hurt with the falls they got by leaping | gulliverstravels
from my sides upon the ground.  However, they soon returned, and one of | gulliverstravels
them, who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face, lifting up | gulliverstravels
his hands and eyes by way of admiration, cried out in a shrill but | gulliverstravels
distinct voice, _Hekinah degul_: the others repeated the same words | gulliverstravels
several times, but then I knew not what they meant.  I lay all this | gulliverstravels
while, as the reader may believe, in great uneasiness.  At length, | gulliverstravels
struggling to get loose, I had the fortune to break the strings, and | gulliverstravels
wrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground; for, by | gulliverstravels
lifting it up to my face, I discovered the methods they had taken to bind | gulliverstravels
me, and at the same time with a violent pull, which gave me excessive | gulliverstravels
pain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the left | gulliverstravels
side, so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches.  But the | gulliverstravels
creatures ran off a second time, before I could seize them; whereupon | gulliverstravels
there was a great shout in a very shrill accent, and after it ceased I | gulliverstravels
heard one of them cry aloud _Tolgo phonac_; when in an instant I felt | gulliverstravels
above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand, which, pricked me like | gulliverstravels
so many needles; and besides, they shot another flight into the air, as | gulliverstravels
we do bombs in Europe, whereof many, I suppose, fell on my body, (though | gulliverstravels
I felt them not), and some on my face, which I immediately covered with | gulliverstravels
my left hand.  When this shower of arrows was over, I fell a groaning | gulliverstravels
with grief and pain; and then striving again to get loose, they | gulliverstravels
discharged another volley larger than the first, and some of them | gulliverstravels
attempted with spears to stick me in the sides; but by good luck I had on | gulliverstravels
a buff jerkin, which they could not pierce.  I thought it the most | gulliverstravels
prudent method to lie still, and my design was to continue so till night, | gulliverstravels
when, my left hand being already loose, I could easily free myself: and | gulliverstravels
as for the inhabitants, I had reason to believe I might be a match for | gulliverstravels
the greatest army they could bring against me, if they were all of the | gulliverstravels
same size with him that I saw.  But fortune disposed otherwise of me. | gulliverstravels
When the people observed I was quiet, they discharged no more arrows; | gulliverstravels
but, by the noise I heard, I knew their numbers increased; and about four | gulliverstravels
yards from me, over against my right ear, I heard a knocking for above an | gulliverstravels
hour, like that of people at work; when turning my head that way, as well | gulliverstravels
as the pegs and strings would permit me, I saw a stage erected about a | gulliverstravels
foot and a half from the ground, capable of holding four of the | gulliverstravels
inhabitants, with two or three ladders to mount it: from whence one of | gulliverstravels
them, who seemed to be a person of quality, made me a long speech, | gulliverstravels
whereof I understood not one syllable.  But I should have mentioned, that | gulliverstravels
before the principal person began his oration, he cried out three times, | gulliverstravels
_Langro dehul san_ (these words and the former were afterwards repeated | gulliverstravels
and explained to me); whereupon, immediately, about fifty of the | gulliverstravels
inhabitants came and cut the strings that fastened the left side of my | gulliverstravels
head, which gave me the liberty of turning it to the right, and of | gulliverstravels
observing the person and gesture of him that was to speak.  He appeared | gulliverstravels
to be of a middle age, and taller than any of the other three who | gulliverstravels
attended him, whereof one was a page that held up his train, and seemed | gulliverstravels
to be somewhat longer than my middle finger; the other two stood one on | gulliverstravels
each side to support him.  He acted every part of an orator, and I could | gulliverstravels
observe many periods of threatenings, and others of promises, pity, and | gulliverstravels
kindness.  I answered in a few words, but in the most submissive manner, | gulliverstravels
lifting up my left hand, and both my eyes to the sun, as calling him for | gulliverstravels
a witness; and being almost famished with hunger, having not eaten a | gulliverstravels
morsel for some hours before I left the ship, I found the demands of | gulliverstravels
nature so strong upon me, that I could not forbear showing my impatience | gulliverstravels
(perhaps against the strict rules of decency) by putting my finger | gulliverstravels
frequently to my mouth, to signify that I wanted food.  The _hurgo_ (for | gulliverstravels
so they call a great lord, as I afterwards learnt) understood me very | gulliverstravels
well.  He descended from the stage, and commanded that several ladders | gulliverstravels
should be applied to my sides, on which above a hundred of the | gulliverstravels
inhabitants mounted and walked towards my mouth, laden with baskets full | gulliverstravels
of meat, which had been provided and sent thither by the king’s orders, | gulliverstravels
upon the first intelligence he received of me.  I observed there was the | gulliverstravels
flesh of several animals, but could not distinguish them by the taste. | gulliverstravels
There were shoulders, legs, and loins, shaped like those of mutton, and | gulliverstravels
very well dressed, but smaller than the wings of a lark.  I ate them by | gulliverstravels
two or three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a time, about the | gulliverstravels
bigness of musket bullets.  They supplied me as fast as they could, | gulliverstravels
showing a thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and | gulliverstravels
appetite.  I then made another sign, that I wanted drink.  They found by | gulliverstravels
my eating that a small quantity would not suffice me; and being a most | gulliverstravels
ingenious people, they slung up, with great dexterity, one of their | gulliverstravels
largest hogsheads, then rolled it towards my hand, and beat out the top; | gulliverstravels
I drank it off at a draught, which I might well do, for it did not hold | gulliverstravels
half a pint, and tasted like a small wine of Burgundy, but much more | gulliverstravels
delicious.  They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank in the same | gulliverstravels
manner, and made signs for more; but they had none to give me.  When I | gulliverstravels
had performed these wonders, they shouted for joy, and danced upon my | gulliverstravels
breast, repeating several times as they did at first, _Hekinah degul_. | gulliverstravels
They made me a sign that I should throw down the two hogsheads, but first | gulliverstravels
warning the people below to stand out of the way, crying aloud, _Borach | gulliverstravels
mevolah_; and when they saw the vessels in the air, there was a universal | gulliverstravels
shout of _Hekinah degul_.  I confess I was often tempted, while they were | gulliverstravels
passing backwards and forwards on my body, to seize forty or fifty of the | gulliverstravels
first that came in my reach, and dash them against the ground.  But the | gulliverstravels
remembrance of what I had felt, which probably might not be the worst | gulliverstravels
they could do, and the promise of honour I made them—for so I interpreted | gulliverstravels
my submissive behaviour—soon drove out these imaginations.  Besides, I | gulliverstravels
now considered myself as bound by the laws of hospitality, to a people | gulliverstravels
who had treated me with so much expense and magnificence.  However, in my | gulliverstravels
thoughts I could not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these | gulliverstravels
diminutive mortals, who durst venture to mount and walk upon my body, | gulliverstravels
while one of my hands was at liberty, without trembling at the very sight | gulliverstravels
of so prodigious a creature as I must appear to them.  After some time, | gulliverstravels
when they observed that I made no more demands for meat, there appeared | gulliverstravels
before me a person of high rank from his imperial majesty.  His | gulliverstravels
excellency, having mounted on the small of my right leg, advanced | gulliverstravels
forwards up to my face, with about a dozen of his retinue; and producing | gulliverstravels
his credentials under the signet royal, which he applied close to my | gulliverstravels
eyes, spoke about ten minutes without any signs of anger, but with a kind | gulliverstravels
of determinate resolution, often pointing forwards, which, as I | gulliverstravels
afterwards found, was towards the capital city, about half a mile | gulliverstravels
distant; whither it was agreed by his majesty in council that I must be | gulliverstravels
conveyed.  I answered in few words, but to no purpose, and made a sign | gulliverstravels
with my hand that was loose, putting it to the other (but over his | gulliverstravels
excellency’s head for fear of hurting him or his train) and then to my | gulliverstravels
own head and body, to signify that I desired my liberty.  It appeared | gulliverstravels
that he understood me well enough, for he shook his head by way of | gulliverstravels
disapprobation, and held his hand in a posture to show that I must be | gulliverstravels
carried as a prisoner.  However, he made other signs to let me understand | gulliverstravels
that I should have meat and drink enough, and very good treatment. | gulliverstravels
Whereupon I once more thought of attempting to break my bonds; but again, | gulliverstravels
when I felt the smart of their arrows upon my face and hands, which were | gulliverstravels
all in blisters, and many of the darts still sticking in them, and | gulliverstravels
observing likewise that the number of my enemies increased, I gave tokens | gulliverstravels
to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased.  Upon | gulliverstravels
this, the _hurgo_ and his train withdrew, with much civility and cheerful | gulliverstravels
countenances.  Soon after I heard a general shout, with frequent | gulliverstravels
repetitions of the words _Peplom selan_; and I felt great numbers of | gulliverstravels
people on my left side relaxing the cords to such a degree, that I was | gulliverstravels
able to turn upon my right, and to ease myself with making water; which I | gulliverstravels
very plentifully did, to the great astonishment of the people; who, | gulliverstravels
conjecturing by my motion what I was going to do, immediately opened to | gulliverstravels
the right and left on that side, to avoid the torrent, which fell with | gulliverstravels
such noise and violence from me.  But before this, they had daubed my | gulliverstravels
face and both my hands with a sort of ointment, very pleasant to the | gulliverstravels
smell, which, in a few minutes, removed all the smart of their arrows. | gulliverstravels
These circumstances, added to the refreshment I had received by their | gulliverstravels
victuals and drink, which were very nourishing, disposed me to sleep.  I | gulliverstravels
slept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured; and it was no | gulliverstravels
wonder, for the physicians, by the emperor’s order, had mingled a sleepy | gulliverstravels
potion in the hogsheads of wine. | gulliverstravels
It seems, that upon the first moment I was discovered sleeping on the | gulliverstravels
ground, after my landing, the emperor had early notice of it by an | gulliverstravels
express; and determined in council, that I should be tied in the manner I | gulliverstravels
have related, (which was done in the night while I slept;) that plenty of | gulliverstravels
meat and drink should be sent to me, and a machine prepared to carry me | gulliverstravels
to the capital city. | gulliverstravels
This resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous, and I am | gulliverstravels
confident would not be imitated by any prince in Europe on the like | gulliverstravels
occasion.  However, in my opinion, it was extremely prudent, as well as | gulliverstravels
generous: for, supposing these people had endeavoured to kill me with | gulliverstravels
their spears and arrows, while I was asleep, I should certainly have | gulliverstravels
awaked with the first sense of smart, which might so far have roused my | gulliverstravels
rage and strength, as to have enabled me to break the strings wherewith I | gulliverstravels
was tied; after which, as they were not able to make resistance, so they | gulliverstravels
could expect no mercy. | gulliverstravels
These people are most excellent mathematicians, and arrived to a great | gulliverstravels
perfection in mechanics, by the countenance and encouragement of the | gulliverstravels
emperor, who is a renowned patron of learning.  This prince has several | gulliverstravels
machines fixed on wheels, for the carriage of trees and other great | gulliverstravels
weights.  He often builds his largest men of war, whereof some are nine | gulliverstravels
feet long, in the woods where the timber grows, and has them carried on | gulliverstravels
these engines three or four hundred yards to the sea.  Five hundred | gulliverstravels
carpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to prepare the | gulliverstravels
greatest engine they had.  It was a frame of wood raised three inches | gulliverstravels
from the ground, about seven feet long, and four wide, moving upon | gulliverstravels
twenty-two wheels.  The shout I heard was upon the arrival of this | gulliverstravels
engine, which, it seems, set out in four hours after my landing.  It was | gulliverstravels
brought parallel to me, as I lay.  But the principal difficulty was to | gulliverstravels
raise and place me in this vehicle.  Eighty poles, each of one foot high, | gulliverstravels
were erected for this purpose, and very strong cords, of the bigness of | gulliverstravels
packthread, were fastened by hooks to many bandages, which the workmen | gulliverstravels
had girt round my neck, my hands, my body, and my legs.  Nine hundred of | gulliverstravels
the strongest men were employed to draw up these cords, by many pulleys | gulliverstravels
fastened on the poles; and thus, in less than three hours, I was raised | gulliverstravels
and slung into the engine, and there tied fast.  All this I was told; | gulliverstravels
for, while the operation was performing, I lay in a profound sleep, by | gulliverstravels
the force of that soporiferous medicine infused into my liquor.  Fifteen | gulliverstravels
hundred of the emperor’s largest horses, each about four inches and a | gulliverstravels
half high, were employed to draw me towards the metropolis, which, as I | gulliverstravels
said, was half a mile distant. | gulliverstravels
About four hours after we began our journey, I awaked by a very | gulliverstravels
ridiculous accident; for the carriage being stopped a while, to adjust | gulliverstravels
something that was out of order, two or three of the young natives had | gulliverstravels
the curiosity to see how I looked when I was asleep; they climbed up into | gulliverstravels
the engine, and advancing very softly to my face, one of them, an officer | gulliverstravels
in the guards, put the sharp end of his half-pike a good way up into my | gulliverstravels
left nostril, which tickled my nose like a straw, and made me sneeze | gulliverstravels
violently; whereupon they stole off unperceived, and it was three weeks | gulliverstravels
before I knew the cause of my waking so suddenly.  We made a long march | gulliverstravels
the remaining part of the day, and, rested at night with five hundred | gulliverstravels
guards on each side of me, half with torches, and half with bows and | gulliverstravels
arrows, ready to shoot me if I should offer to stir.  The next morning at | gulliverstravels
sun-rise we continued our march, and arrived within two hundred yards of | gulliverstravels
the city gates about noon.  The emperor, and all his court, came out to | gulliverstravels
meet us; but his great officers would by no means suffer his majesty to | gulliverstravels
endanger his person by mounting on my body. | gulliverstravels
At the place where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple, | gulliverstravels
esteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom; which, having been | gulliverstravels
polluted some years before by an unnatural murder, was, according to the | gulliverstravels
zeal of those people, looked upon as profane, and therefore had been | gulliverstravels
applied to common use, and all the ornaments and furniture carried away. | gulliverstravels
In this edifice it was determined I should lodge.  The great gate | gulliverstravels
fronting to the north was about four feet high, and almost two feet wide, | gulliverstravels
through which I could easily creep.  On each side of the gate was a small | gulliverstravels
window, not above six inches from the ground: into that on the left side, | gulliverstravels
the king’s smith conveyed fourscore and eleven chains, like those that | gulliverstravels
hang to a lady’s watch in Europe, and almost as large, which were locked | gulliverstravels
to my left leg with six-and-thirty padlocks.  Over against this temple, | gulliverstravels
on the other side of the great highway, at twenty feet distance, there | gulliverstravels
was a turret at least five feet high.  Here the emperor ascended, with | gulliverstravels
many principal lords of his court, to have an opportunity of viewing me, | gulliverstravels
as I was told, for I could not see them.  It was reckoned that above a | gulliverstravels
hundred thousand inhabitants came out of the town upon the same errand; | gulliverstravels
and, in spite of my guards, I believe there could not be fewer than ten | gulliverstravels
thousand at several times, who mounted my body by the help of ladders. | gulliverstravels
But a proclamation was soon issued, to forbid it upon pain of death. | gulliverstravels
When the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose, they cut | gulliverstravels
all the strings that bound me; whereupon I rose up, with as melancholy a | gulliverstravels
disposition as ever I had in my life.  But the noise and astonishment of | gulliverstravels
the people, at seeing me rise and walk, are not to be expressed.  The | gulliverstravels
chains that held my left leg were about two yards long, and gave me not | gulliverstravels
only the liberty of walking backwards and forwards in a semicircle, but, | gulliverstravels
being fixed within four inches of the gate, allowed me to creep in, and | gulliverstravels
lie at my full length in the temple. | gulliverstravels
CHAPTER II. | gulliverstravels
The emperor of Lilliput, attended by several of the nobility, comes to | gulliverstravels
see the author in his confinement.  The emperor’s person and habit | gulliverstravels
described.  Learned men appointed to teach the author their language.  He | gulliverstravels
gains favour by his mild disposition.  His pockets are searched, and his | gulliverstravels
sword and pistols taken from him. | gulliverstravels
When I found myself on my feet, I looked about me, and must confess I | gulliverstravels
never beheld a more entertaining prospect.  The country around appeared | gulliverstravels
like a continued garden, and the enclosed fields, which were generally | gulliverstravels
forty feet square, resembled so many beds of flowers.  These fields were | gulliverstravels
intermingled with woods of half a stang, {301} and the tallest trees, as | gulliverstravels
I could judge, appeared to be seven feet high.  I viewed the town on my | gulliverstravels
left hand, which looked like the painted scene of a city in a theatre. | gulliverstravels
I had been for some hours extremely pressed by the necessities of nature; | gulliverstravels
which was no wonder, it being almost two days since I had last | gulliverstravels
disburdened myself.  I was under great difficulties between urgency and | gulliverstravels
shame.  The best expedient I could think of, was to creep into my house, | gulliverstravels
which I accordingly did; and shutting the gate after me, I went as far as | gulliverstravels
the length of my chain would suffer, and discharged my body of that | gulliverstravels
uneasy load.  But this was the only time I was ever guilty of so | gulliverstravels
uncleanly an action; for which I cannot but hope the candid reader will | gulliverstravels
give some allowance, after he has maturely and impartially considered my | gulliverstravels
case, and the distress I was in.  From this time my constant practice | gulliverstravels
was, as soon as I rose, to perform that business in open air, at the full | gulliverstravels
extent of my chain; and due care was taken every morning before company | gulliverstravels
came, that the offensive matter should be carried off in wheel-barrows, | gulliverstravels
by two servants appointed for that purpose.  I would not have dwelt so | gulliverstravels
long upon a circumstance that, perhaps, at first sight, may appear not | gulliverstravels
very momentous, if I had not thought it necessary to justify my | gulliverstravels
character, in point of cleanliness, to the world; which, I am told, some | gulliverstravels
of my maligners have been pleased, upon this and other occasions, to call | gulliverstravels
in question. | gulliverstravels
When this adventure was at an end, I came back out of my house, having | gulliverstravels
occasion for fresh air.  The emperor was already descended from the | gulliverstravels
tower, and advancing on horseback towards me, which had like to have cost | gulliverstravels
him dear; for the beast, though very well trained, yet wholly unused to | gulliverstravels
such a sight, which appeared as if a mountain moved before him, reared up | gulliverstravels
on its hinder feet: but that prince, who is an excellent horseman, kept | gulliverstravels
his seat, till his attendants ran in, and held the bridle, while his | gulliverstravels
majesty had time to dismount.  When he alighted, he surveyed me round | gulliverstravels
with great admiration; but kept beyond the length of my chain.  He | gulliverstravels
ordered his cooks and butlers, who were already prepared, to give me | gulliverstravels
victuals and drink, which they pushed forward in a sort of vehicles upon | gulliverstravels
wheels, till I could reach them.  I took these vehicles and soon emptied | gulliverstravels
them all; twenty of them were filled with meat, and ten with liquor; each | gulliverstravels
of the former afforded me two or three good mouthfuls; and I emptied the | gulliverstravels
liquor of ten vessels, which was contained in earthen vials, into one | gulliverstravels
vehicle, drinking it off at a draught; and so I did with the rest.  The | gulliverstravels
empress, and young princes of the blood of both sexes, attended by many | gulliverstravels
ladies, sat at some distance in their chairs; but upon the accident that | gulliverstravels
happened to the emperor’s horse, they alighted, and came near his person, | gulliverstravels
which I am now going to describe.  He is taller by almost the breadth of | gulliverstravels
my nail, than any of his court; which alone is enough to strike an awe | gulliverstravels
into the beholders.  His features are strong and masculine, with an | gulliverstravels
Austrian lip and arched nose, his complexion olive, his countenance | gulliverstravels
erect, his body and limbs well proportioned, all his motions graceful, | gulliverstravels
and his deportment majestic.  He was then past his prime, being | gulliverstravels
twenty-eight years and three quarters old, of which he had reigned about | gulliverstravels
seven in great felicity, and generally victorious.  For the better | gulliverstravels
convenience of beholding him, I lay on my side, so that my face was | gulliverstravels
parallel to his, and he stood but three yards off: however, I have had | gulliverstravels
him since many times in my hand, and therefore cannot be deceived in the | gulliverstravels
description.  His dress was very plain and simple, and the fashion of it | gulliverstravels
between the Asiatic and the European; but he had on his head a light | gulliverstravels
helmet of gold, adorned with jewels, and a plume on the crest.  He held | gulliverstravels
his sword drawn in his hand to defend himself, if I should happen to | gulliverstravels
break loose; it was almost three inches long; the hilt and scabbard were | gulliverstravels
gold enriched with diamonds.  His voice was shrill, but very clear and | gulliverstravels
articulate; and I could distinctly hear it when I stood up.  The ladies | gulliverstravels
and courtiers were all most magnificently clad; so that the spot they | gulliverstravels
stood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread upon the ground, | gulliverstravels
embroidered with figures of gold and silver.  His imperial majesty spoke | gulliverstravels
often to me, and I returned answers: but neither of us could understand a | gulliverstravels
syllable.  There were several of his priests and lawyers present (as I | gulliverstravels
conjectured by their habits), who were commanded to address themselves to | gulliverstravels
me; and I spoke to them in as many languages as I had the least | gulliverstravels
smattering of, which were High and Low Dutch, Latin, French, Spanish, | gulliverstravels
Italian, and Lingua Franca, but all to no purpose.  After about two hours | gulliverstravels
the court retired, and I was left with a strong guard, to prevent the | gulliverstravels
impertinence, and probably the malice of the rabble, who were very | gulliverstravels
impatient to crowd about me as near as they durst; and some of them had | gulliverstravels
the impudence to shoot their arrows at me, as I sat on the ground by the | gulliverstravels
door of my house, whereof one very narrowly missed my left eye.  But the | gulliverstravels
colonel ordered six of the ringleaders to be seized, and thought no | gulliverstravels
punishment so proper as to deliver them bound into my hands; which some | gulliverstravels
of his soldiers accordingly did, pushing them forward with the butt-ends | gulliverstravels
of their pikes into my reach.  I took them all in my right hand, put five | gulliverstravels
of them into my coat-pocket; and as to the sixth, I made a countenance as | gulliverstravels
if I would eat him alive.  The poor man squalled terribly, and the | gulliverstravels
colonel and his officers were in much pain, especially when they saw me | gulliverstravels
take out my penknife: but I soon put them out of fear; for, looking | gulliverstravels
mildly, and immediately cutting the strings he was bound with, I set him | gulliverstravels
gently on the ground, and away he ran.  I treated the rest in the same | gulliverstravels
manner, taking them one by one out of my pocket; and I observed both the | gulliverstravels
soldiers and people were highly delighted at this mark of my clemency, | gulliverstravels
which was represented very much to my advantage at court. | gulliverstravels
Towards night I got with some difficulty into my house, where I lay on | gulliverstravels
the ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight; during which time, | gulliverstravels
the emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me.  Six hundred beds | gulliverstravels
of the common measure were brought in carriages, and worked up in my | gulliverstravels
house; a hundred and fifty of their beds, sewn together, made up the | gulliverstravels
breadth and length; and these were four double: which, however, kept me | gulliverstravels
but very indifferently from the hardness of the floor, that was of smooth | gulliverstravels
stone.  By the same computation, they provided me with sheets, blankets, | gulliverstravels
and coverlets, tolerable enough for one who had been so long inured to | gulliverstravels
hardships. | gulliverstravels
As the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom, it brought | gulliverstravels
prodigious numbers of rich, idle, and curious people to see me; so that | gulliverstravels
the villages were almost emptied; and great neglect of tillage and | gulliverstravels
household affairs must have ensued, if his imperial majesty had not | gulliverstravels
provided, by several proclamations and orders of state, against this | gulliverstravels
inconveniency.  He directed that those who had already beheld me should | gulliverstravels
return home, and not presume to come within fifty yards of my house, | gulliverstravels
without license from the court; whereby the secretaries of state got | gulliverstravels
considerable fees. | gulliverstravels
In the mean time the emperor held frequent councils, to debate what | gulliverstravels
course should be taken with me; and I was afterwards assured by a | gulliverstravels
particular friend, a person of great quality, who was as much in the | gulliverstravels
secret as any, that the court was under many difficulties concerning me. | gulliverstravels
They apprehended my breaking loose; that my diet would be very expensive, | gulliverstravels
and might cause a famine.  Sometimes they determined to starve me; or at | gulliverstravels
least to shoot me in the face and hands with poisoned arrows, which would | gulliverstravels
soon despatch me; but again they considered, that the stench of so large | gulliverstravels
a carcass might produce a plague in the metropolis, and probably spread | gulliverstravels
through the whole kingdom.  In the midst of these consultations, several | gulliverstravels
officers of the army went to the door of the great council-chamber, and | gulliverstravels
two of them being admitted, gave an account of my behaviour to the six | gulliverstravels
criminals above-mentioned; which made so favourable an impression in the | gulliverstravels
breast of his majesty and the whole board, in my behalf, that an imperial | gulliverstravels
commission was issued out, obliging all the villages, nine hundred yards | gulliverstravels
round the city, to deliver in every morning six beeves, forty sheep, and | gulliverstravels
other victuals for my sustenance; together with a proportionable quantity | gulliverstravels
of bread, and wine, and other liquors; for the due payment of which, his | gulliverstravels
majesty gave assignments upon his treasury:—for this prince lives chiefly | gulliverstravels
upon his own demesnes; seldom, except upon great occasions, raising any | gulliverstravels
subsidies upon his subjects, who are bound to attend him in his wars at | gulliverstravels
their own expense.  An establishment was also made of six hundred persons | gulliverstravels
to be my domestics, who had board-wages allowed for their maintenance, | gulliverstravels
and tents built for them very conveniently on each side of my door.  It | gulliverstravels
was likewise ordered, that three hundred tailors should make me a suit of | gulliverstravels
clothes, after the fashion of the country; that six of his majesty’s | gulliverstravels
greatest scholars should be employed to instruct me in their language; | gulliverstravels
and lastly, that the emperor’s horses, and those of the nobility and | gulliverstravels
troops of guards, should be frequently exercised in my sight, to accustom | gulliverstravels
themselves to me.  All these orders were duly put in execution; and in | gulliverstravels
about three weeks I made a great progress in learning their language; | gulliverstravels
during which time the emperor frequently honoured me with his visits, and | gulliverstravels
was pleased to assist my masters in teaching me.  We began already to | gulliverstravels
converse together in some sort; and the first words I learnt, were to | gulliverstravels
express my desire “that he would please give me my liberty;” which I | gulliverstravels
every day repeated on my knees.  His answer, as I could comprehend it, | gulliverstravels
was, “that this must be a work of time, not to be thought on without the | gulliverstravels
advice of his council, and that first I must _lumos kelmin pesso desmar | gulliverstravels
lon emposo_;” that is, swear a peace with him and his kingdom.  However, | gulliverstravels
that I should be used with all kindness.  And he advised me to “acquire, | gulliverstravels
by my patience and discreet behaviour, the good opinion of himself and | gulliverstravels
his subjects.”  He desired “I would not take it ill, if he gave orders to | gulliverstravels
certain proper officers to search me; for probably I might carry about me | gulliverstravels
several weapons, which must needs be dangerous things, if they answered | gulliverstravels
the bulk of so prodigious a person.”  I said, “His majesty should be | gulliverstravels
satisfied; for I was ready to strip myself, and turn up my pockets before | gulliverstravels
him.”  This I delivered part in words, and part in signs.  He replied, | gulliverstravels
“that, by the laws of the kingdom, I must be searched by two of his | gulliverstravels
officers; that he knew this could not be done without my consent and | gulliverstravels
assistance; and he had so good an opinion of my generosity and justice, | gulliverstravels
as to trust their persons in my hands; that whatever they took from me, | gulliverstravels
should be returned when I left the country, or paid for at the rate which | gulliverstravels
I would set upon them.”  I took up the two officers in my hands, put them | gulliverstravels
first into my coat-pockets, and then into every other pocket about me, | gulliverstravels
except my two fobs, and another secret pocket, which I had no mind should | gulliverstravels
be searched, wherein I had some little necessaries that were of no | gulliverstravels
consequence to any but myself.  In one of my fobs there was a silver | gulliverstravels
watch, and in the other a small quantity of gold in a purse.  These | gulliverstravels
gentlemen, having pen, ink, and paper, about them, made an exact | gulliverstravels
inventory of every thing they saw; and when they had done, desired I | gulliverstravels
would set them down, that they might deliver it to the emperor.  This | gulliverstravels
inventory I afterwards translated into English, and is, word for word, as | gulliverstravels
follows: | gulliverstravels
    “_Imprimis_: In the right coat-pocket of the great man-mountain” (for | gulliverstravels
    so I interpret the words _quinbus flestrin_,) “after the strictest | gulliverstravels
    search, we found only one great piece of coarse-cloth, large enough | gulliverstravels
    to be a foot-cloth for your majesty’s chief room of state.  In the | gulliverstravels
    left pocket we saw a huge silver chest, with a cover of the same | gulliverstravels
    metal, which we, the searchers, were not able to lift.  We desired it | gulliverstravels
    should be opened, and one of us stepping into it, found himself up to | gulliverstravels
    the mid leg in a sort of dust, some part whereof flying up to our | gulliverstravels
    faces set us both a sneezing for several times together.  In his | gulliverstravels
    right waistcoat-pocket we found a prodigious bundle of white thin | gulliverstravels
    substances, folded one over another, about the bigness of three men, | gulliverstravels
    tied with a strong cable, and marked with black figures; which we | gulliverstravels
    humbly conceive to be writings, every letter almost half as large as | gulliverstravels
    the palm of our hands.  In the left there was a sort of engine, from | gulliverstravels
    the back of which were extended twenty long poles, resembling the | gulliverstravels
    pallisados before your majesty’s court: wherewith we conjecture the | gulliverstravels
    man-mountain combs his head; for we did not always trouble him with | gulliverstravels
    questions, because we found it a great difficulty to make him | gulliverstravels
    understand us.  In the large pocket, on the right side of his middle | gulliverstravels
    cover” (so I translate the word _ranfulo_, by which they meant my | gulliverstravels
    breeches,) “we saw a hollow pillar of iron, about the length of a | gulliverstravels
    man, fastened to a strong piece of timber larger than the pillar; and | gulliverstravels
    upon one side of the pillar, were huge pieces of iron sticking out, | gulliverstravels
    cut into strange figures, which we know not what to make of.  In the | gulliverstravels
    left pocket, another engine of the same kind.  In the smaller pocket | gulliverstravels
    on the right side, were several round flat pieces of white and red | gulliverstravels
    metal, of different bulk; some of the white, which seemed to be | gulliverstravels
    silver, were so large and heavy, that my comrade and I could hardly | gulliverstravels
    lift them.  In the left pocket were two black pillars irregularly | gulliverstravels
    shaped: we could not, without difficulty, reach the top of them, as | gulliverstravels
    we stood at the bottom of his pocket.  One of them was covered, and | gulliverstravels
    seemed all of a piece: but at the upper end of the other there | gulliverstravels
    appeared a white round substance, about twice the bigness of our | gulliverstravels
    heads.  Within each of these was enclosed a prodigious plate of | gulliverstravels
    steel; which, by our orders, we obliged him to show us, because we | gulliverstravels
    apprehended they might be dangerous engines.  He took them out of | gulliverstravels
    their cases, and told us, that in his own country his practice was to | gulliverstravels
    shave his beard with one of these, and cut his meat with the other. | gulliverstravels
    There were two pockets which we could not enter: these he called his | gulliverstravels
    fobs; they were two large slits cut into the top of his middle cover, | gulliverstravels
    but squeezed close by the pressure of his belly.  Out of the right | gulliverstravels
    fob hung a great silver chain, with a wonderful kind of engine at the | gulliverstravels
    bottom.  We directed him to draw out whatever was at the end of that | gulliverstravels
    chain; which appeared to be a globe, half silver, and half of some | gulliverstravels
    transparent metal; for, on the transparent side, we saw certain | gulliverstravels
    strange figures circularly drawn, and thought we could touch them, | gulliverstravels
    till we found our fingers stopped by the lucid substance.  He put | gulliverstravels
    this engine into our ears, which made an incessant noise, like that | gulliverstravels
    of a water-mill: and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal, | gulliverstravels
    or the god that he worships; but we are more inclined to the latter | gulliverstravels
    opinion, because he assured us, (if we understood him right, for he | gulliverstravels
    expressed himself very imperfectly) that he seldom did any thing | gulliverstravels
    without consulting it.  He called it his oracle, and said, it pointed | gulliverstravels
    out the time for every action of his life.  From the left fob he took | gulliverstravels
    out a net almost large enough for a fisherman, but contrived to open | gulliverstravels
    and shut like a purse, and served him for the same use: we found | gulliverstravels
    therein several massy pieces of yellow metal, which, if they be real | gulliverstravels
    gold, must be of immense value. | gulliverstravels
    “Having thus, in obedience to your majesty’s commands, diligently | gulliverstravels
    searched all his pockets, we observed a girdle about his waist made | gulliverstravels
    of the hide of some prodigious animal, from which, on the left side, | gulliverstravels
    hung a sword of the length of five men; and on the right, a bag or | gulliverstravels
    pouch divided into two cells, each cell capable of holding three of | gulliverstravels
    your majesty’s subjects.  In one of these cells were several globes, | gulliverstravels
    or balls, of a most ponderous metal, about the bigness of our heads, | gulliverstravels
    and requiring a strong hand to lift them: the other cell contained a | gulliverstravels
    heap of certain black grains, but of no great bulk or weight, for we | gulliverstravels
    could hold above fifty of them in the palms of our hands. | gulliverstravels
    “This is an exact inventory of what we found about the body of the | gulliverstravels
    man-mountain, who used us with great civility, and due respect to | gulliverstravels
    your majesty’s commission.  Signed and sealed on the fourth day of | gulliverstravels
    the eighty-ninth moon of your majesty’s auspicious reign. | gulliverstravels
                                          CLEFRIN FRELOCK, MARSI FRELOCK.” | gulliverstravels
When this inventory was read over to the emperor, he directed me, | gulliverstravels
although in very gentle terms, to deliver up the several particulars.  He | gulliverstravels
first called for my scimitar, which I took out, scabbard and all.  In the | gulliverstravels
mean time he ordered three thousand of his choicest troops (who then | gulliverstravels
attended him) to surround me at a distance, with their bows and arrows | gulliverstravels
just ready to discharge; but I did not observe it, for mine eyes were | gulliverstravels
wholly fixed upon his majesty.  He then desired me to draw my scimitar, | gulliverstravels
which, although it had got some rust by the sea water, was, in most | gulliverstravels
parts, exceeding bright.  I did so, and immediately all the troops gave a | gulliverstravels
shout between terror and surprise; for the sun shone clear, and the | gulliverstravels
reflection dazzled their eyes, as I waved the scimitar to and fro in my | gulliverstravels
hand.  His majesty, who is a most magnanimous prince, was less daunted | gulliverstravels
than I could expect: he ordered me to return it into the scabbard, and | gulliverstravels
cast it on the ground as gently as I could, about six feet from the end | gulliverstravels
of my chain.  The next thing he demanded was one of the hollow iron | gulliverstravels
pillars; by which he meant my pocket pistols.  I drew it out, and at his | gulliverstravels
desire, as well as I could, expressed to him the use of it; and charging | gulliverstravels
it only with powder, which, by the closeness of my pouch, happened to | gulliverstravels
escape wetting in the sea (an inconvenience against which all prudent | gulliverstravels
mariners take special care to provide,) I first cautioned the emperor not | gulliverstravels
to be afraid, and then I let it off in the air.  The astonishment here | gulliverstravels
was much greater than at the sight of my scimitar.  Hundreds fell down as | gulliverstravels
if they had been struck dead; and even the emperor, although he stood his | gulliverstravels
ground, could not recover himself for some time.  I delivered up both my | gulliverstravels
pistols in the same manner as I had done my scimitar, and then my pouch | gulliverstravels
of powder and bullets; begging him that the former might be kept from | gulliverstravels
fire, for it would kindle with the smallest spark, and blow up his | gulliverstravels
imperial palace into the air.  I likewise delivered up my watch, which | gulliverstravels
the emperor was very curious to see, and commanded two of his tallest | gulliverstravels
yeomen of the guards to bear it on a pole upon their shoulders, as | gulliverstravels
draymen in England do a barrel of ale.  He was amazed at the continual | gulliverstravels
noise it made, and the motion of the minute-hand, which he could easily | gulliverstravels
discern; for their sight is much more acute than ours: he asked the | gulliverstravels
opinions of his learned men about it, which were various and remote, as | gulliverstravels
the reader may well imagine without my repeating; although indeed I could | gulliverstravels
not very perfectly understand them.  I then gave up my silver and copper | gulliverstravels
money, my purse, with nine large pieces of gold, and some smaller ones; | gulliverstravels
my knife and razor, my comb and silver snuff-box, my handkerchief and | gulliverstravels
journal-book.  My scimitar, pistols, and pouch, were conveyed in | gulliverstravels
carriages to his majesty’s stores; but the rest of my goods were returned | gulliverstravels
me. | gulliverstravels
I had as I before observed, one private pocket, which escaped their | gulliverstravels
search, wherein there was a pair of spectacles (which I sometimes use for | gulliverstravels
the weakness of mine eyes,) a pocket perspective, and some other little | gulliverstravels
conveniences; which, being of no consequence to the emperor, I did not | gulliverstravels
think myself bound in honour to discover, and I apprehended they might be | gulliverstravels
lost or spoiled if I ventured them out of my possession. | gulliverstravels
CHAPTER III. | gulliverstravels
The author diverts the emperor, and his nobility of both sexes, in a very | gulliverstravels
uncommon manner.  The diversions of the court of Lilliput described.  The | gulliverstravels
author has his liberty granted him upon certain conditions. | gulliverstravels
My gentleness and good behaviour had gained so far on the emperor and his | gulliverstravels
court, and indeed upon the army and people in general, that I began to | gulliverstravels
conceive hopes of getting my liberty in a short time.  I took all | gulliverstravels
possible methods to cultivate this favourable disposition.  The natives | gulliverstravels
came, by degrees, to be less apprehensive of any danger from me.  I would | gulliverstravels
sometimes lie down, and let five or six of them dance on my hand; and at | gulliverstravels
last the boys and girls would venture to come and play at hide-and-seek | gulliverstravels
in my hair.  I had now made a good progress in understanding and speaking | gulliverstravels
the language.  The emperor had a mind one day to entertain me with | gulliverstravels
several of the country shows, wherein they exceed all nations I have | gulliverstravels
known, both for dexterity and magnificence.  I was diverted with none so | gulliverstravels
much as that of the rope-dancers, performed upon a slender white thread, | gulliverstravels
extended about two feet, and twelve inches from the ground.  Upon which I | gulliverstravels
shall desire liberty, with the reader’s patience, to enlarge a little. | gulliverstravels
This diversion is only practised by those persons who are candidates for | gulliverstravels
great employments, and high favour at court.  They are trained in this | gulliverstravels
art from their youth, and are not always of noble birth, or liberal | gulliverstravels
education.  When a great office is vacant, either by death or disgrace | gulliverstravels
(which often happens,) five or six of those candidates petition the | gulliverstravels
emperor to entertain his majesty and the court with a dance on the rope; | gulliverstravels
and whoever jumps the highest, without falling, succeeds in the office. | gulliverstravels
Very often the chief ministers themselves are commanded to show their | gulliverstravels
skill, and to convince the emperor that they have not lost their faculty. | gulliverstravels
Flimnap, the treasurer, is allowed to cut a caper on the straight rope, | gulliverstravels
at least an inch higher than any other lord in the whole empire.  I have | gulliverstravels
seen him do the summerset several times together, upon a trencher fixed | gulliverstravels
on a rope which is no thicker than a common packthread in England.  My | gulliverstravels
friend Reldresal, principal secretary for private affairs, is, in my | gulliverstravels
opinion, if I am not partial, the second after the treasurer; the rest of | gulliverstravels
the great officers are much upon a par. | gulliverstravels
These diversions are often attended with fatal accidents, whereof great | gulliverstravels
numbers are on record.  I myself have seen two or three candidates break | gulliverstravels
a limb.  But the danger is much greater, when the ministers themselves | gulliverstravels
are commanded to show their dexterity; for, by contending to excel | gulliverstravels
themselves and their fellows, they strain so far that there is hardly one | gulliverstravels
of them who has not received a fall, and some of them two or three.  I | gulliverstravels
was assured that, a year or two before my arrival, Flimnap would | gulliverstravels
infallibly have broke his neck, if one of the king’s cushions, that | gulliverstravels
accidentally lay on the ground, had not weakened the force of his fall. | gulliverstravels
There is likewise another diversion, which is only shown before the | gulliverstravels
emperor and empress, and first minister, upon particular occasions.  The | gulliverstravels
emperor lays on the table three fine silken threads of six inches long; | gulliverstravels
one is blue, the other red, and the third green.  These threads are | gulliverstravels
proposed as prizes for those persons whom the emperor has a mind to | gulliverstravels
distinguish by a peculiar mark of his favour.  The ceremony is performed | gulliverstravels
in his majesty’s great chamber of state, where the candidates are to | gulliverstravels
undergo a trial of dexterity very different from the former, and such as | gulliverstravels
I have not observed the least resemblance of in any other country of the | gulliverstravels
new or old world.  The emperor holds a stick in his hands, both ends | gulliverstravels
parallel to the horizon, while the candidates advancing, one by one, | gulliverstravels
sometimes leap over the stick, sometimes creep under it, backward and | gulliverstravels
forward, several times, according as the stick is advanced or depressed. | gulliverstravels
Sometimes the emperor holds one end of the stick, and his first minister | gulliverstravels
the other; sometimes the minister has it entirely to himself.  Whoever | gulliverstravels
performs his part with most agility, and holds out the longest in leaping | gulliverstravels
and creeping, is rewarded with the blue-coloured silk; the red is given | gulliverstravels
to the next, and the green to the third, which they all wear girt twice | gulliverstravels
round about the middle; and you see few great persons about this court | gulliverstravels
who are not adorned with one of these girdles. | gulliverstravels
The horses of the army, and those of the royal stables, having been daily | gulliverstravels
led before me, were no longer shy, but would come up to my very feet | gulliverstravels
without starting.  The riders would leap them over my hand, as I held it | gulliverstravels
on the ground; and one of the emperor’s huntsmen, upon a large courser, | gulliverstravels
took my foot, shoe and all; which was indeed a prodigious leap.  I had | gulliverstravels
the good fortune to divert the emperor one day after a very extraordinary | gulliverstravels
manner.  I desired he would order several sticks of two feet high, and | gulliverstravels
the thickness of an ordinary cane, to be brought me; whereupon his | gulliverstravels
majesty commanded the master of his woods to give directions accordingly; | gulliverstravels
and the next morning six woodmen arrived with as many carriages, drawn by | gulliverstravels
eight horses to each.  I took nine of these sticks, and fixing them | gulliverstravels
firmly in the ground in a quadrangular figure, two feet and a half | gulliverstravels
square, I took four other sticks, and tied them parallel at each corner, | gulliverstravels
about two feet from the ground; then I fastened my handkerchief to the | gulliverstravels
nine sticks that stood erect; and extended it on all sides, till it was | gulliverstravels
tight as the top of a drum; and the four parallel sticks, rising about | gulliverstravels
five inches higher than the handkerchief, served as ledges on each side. | gulliverstravels
When I had finished my work, I desired the emperor to let a troop of his | gulliverstravels
best horses twenty-four in number, come and exercise upon this plain. | gulliverstravels
His majesty approved of the proposal, and I took them up, one by one, in | gulliverstravels
my hands, ready mounted and armed, with the proper officers to exercise | gulliverstravels
them.  As soon as they got into order they divided into two parties, | gulliverstravels
performed mock skirmishes, discharged blunt arrows, drew their swords, | gulliverstravels
fled and pursued, attacked and retired, and in short discovered the best | gulliverstravels
military discipline I ever beheld.  The parallel sticks secured them and | gulliverstravels
their horses from falling over the stage; and the emperor was so much | gulliverstravels
delighted, that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several | gulliverstravels
days, and once was pleased to be lifted up and give the word of command; | gulliverstravels
and with great difficulty persuaded even the empress herself to let me | gulliverstravels
hold her in her close chair within two yards of the stage, when she was | gulliverstravels
able to take a full view of the whole performance.  It was my good | gulliverstravels
fortune, that no ill accident happened in these entertainments; only once | gulliverstravels
a fiery horse, that belonged to one of the captains, pawing with his | gulliverstravels
hoof, struck a hole in my handkerchief, and his foot slipping, he | gulliverstravels
overthrew his rider and himself; but I immediately relieved them both, | gulliverstravels
and covering the hole with one hand, I set down the troop with the other, | gulliverstravels
in the same manner as I took them up. The horse that fell was strained in | gulliverstravels
the left shoulder, but the rider got no hurt; and I repaired my | gulliverstravels
handkerchief as well as I could: however, I would not trust to the | gulliverstravels
strength of it any more, in such dangerous enterprises. | gulliverstravels
About two or three days before I was set at liberty, as I was | gulliverstravels
entertaining the court with this kind of feat, there arrived an express | gulliverstravels
to inform his majesty, that some of his subjects, riding near the place | gulliverstravels
where I was first taken up, had seen a great black substance lying on the | gulliverstravels
around, very oddly shaped, extending its edges round, as wide as his | gulliverstravels
majesty’s bedchamber, and rising up in the middle as high as a man; that | gulliverstravels
it was no living creature, as they at first apprehended, for it lay on | gulliverstravels
the grass without motion; and some of them had walked round it several | gulliverstravels
times; that, by mounting upon each other’s shoulders, they had got to the | gulliverstravels
top, which was flat and even, and, stamping upon it, they found that it | gulliverstravels
was hollow within; that they humbly conceived it might be something | gulliverstravels
belonging to the man-mountain; and if his majesty pleased, they would | gulliverstravels
undertake to bring it with only five horses.  I presently knew what they | gulliverstravels
meant, and was glad at heart to receive this intelligence.  It seems, | gulliverstravels
upon my first reaching the shore after our shipwreck, I was in such | gulliverstravels
confusion, that before I came to the place where I went to sleep, my hat, | gulliverstravels
which I had fastened with a string to my head while I was rowing, and had | gulliverstravels
stuck on all the time I was swimming, fell off after I came to land; the | gulliverstravels
string, as I conjecture, breaking by some accident, which I never | gulliverstravels
observed, but thought my hat had been lost at sea.  I entreated his | gulliverstravels
imperial majesty to give orders it might be brought to me as soon as | gulliverstravels
possible, describing to him the use and the nature of it: and the next | gulliverstravels
day the waggoners arrived with it, but not in a very good condition; they | gulliverstravels
had bored two holes in the brim, within an inch and half of the edge, and | gulliverstravels
fastened two hooks in the holes; these hooks were tied by a long cord to | gulliverstravels
the harness, and thus my hat was dragged along for above half an English | gulliverstravels
mile; but, the ground in that country being extremely smooth and level, | gulliverstravels
it received less damage than I expected. | gulliverstravels
Two days after this adventure, the emperor, having ordered that part of | gulliverstravels
his army which quarters in and about his metropolis, to be in readiness, | gulliverstravels
took a fancy of diverting himself in a very singular manner.  He desired | gulliverstravels
I would stand like a Colossus, with my legs as far asunder as I | gulliverstravels
conveniently could.  He then commanded his general (who was an old | gulliverstravels
experienced leader, and a great patron of mine) to draw up the troops in | gulliverstravels
close order, and march them under me; the foot by twenty-four abreast, | gulliverstravels
and the horse by sixteen, with drums beating, colours flying, and pikes | gulliverstravels
advanced.  This body consisted of three thousand foot, and a thousand | gulliverstravels
horse.  His majesty gave orders, upon pain of death, that every soldier | gulliverstravels
in his march should observe the strictest decency with regard to my | gulliverstravels
person; which however could not prevent some of the younger officers from | gulliverstravels
turning up their eyes as they passed under me: and, to confess the truth, | gulliverstravels
my breeches were at that time in so ill a condition, that they afforded | gulliverstravels
some opportunities for laughter and admiration. | gulliverstravels
I had sent so many memorials and petitions for my liberty, that his | gulliverstravels
majesty at length mentioned the matter, first in the cabinet, and then in | gulliverstravels
a full council; where it was opposed by none, except Skyresh Bolgolam, | gulliverstravels
who was pleased, without any provocation, to be my mortal enemy.  But it | gulliverstravels
was carried against him by the whole board, and confirmed by the emperor. | gulliverstravels
That minister was _galbet_, or admiral of the realm, very much in his | gulliverstravels
master’s confidence, and a person well versed in affairs, but of a morose | gulliverstravels
and sour complexion.  However, he was at length persuaded to comply; but | gulliverstravels
prevailed that the articles and conditions upon which I should be set | gulliverstravels
free, and to which I must swear, should be drawn up by himself.  These | gulliverstravels
articles were brought to me by Skyresh Bolgolam in person attended by two | gulliverstravels
under-secretaries, and several persons of distinction.  After they were | gulliverstravels
read, I was demanded to swear to the performance of them; first in the | gulliverstravels
manner of my own country, and afterwards in the method prescribed by | gulliverstravels
their laws; which was, to hold my right foot in my left hand, and to | gulliverstravels
place the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of my head, and my | gulliverstravels
thumb on the tip of my right ear.  But because the reader may be curious | gulliverstravels
to have some idea of the style and manner of expression peculiar to that | gulliverstravels
people, as well as to know the article upon which I recovered my liberty, | gulliverstravels
I have made a translation of the whole instrument, word for word, as near | gulliverstravels
as I was able, which I here offer to the public. | gulliverstravels
“Golbasto Momarem Evlame Gurdilo Shefin Mully Ully Gue, most mighty | gulliverstravels
Emperor of Lilliput, delight and terror of the universe, whose dominions | gulliverstravels
extend five thousand _blustrugs_ (about twelve miles in circumference) to | gulliverstravels
the extremities of the globe; monarch of all monarchs, taller than the | gulliverstravels
sons of men; whose feet press down to the centre, and whose head strikes | gulliverstravels
against the sun; at whose nod the princes of the earth shake their knees; | gulliverstravels
pleasant as the spring, comfortable as the summer, fruitful as autumn, | gulliverstravels
dreadful as winter: his most sublime majesty proposes to the | gulliverstravels
man-mountain, lately arrived at our celestial dominions, the following | gulliverstravels
articles, which, by a solemn oath, he shall be obliged to perform:— | gulliverstravels
“1st, The man-mountain shall not depart from our dominions, without our | gulliverstravels
license under our great seal. | gulliverstravels
“2d, He shall not presume to come into our metropolis, without our | gulliverstravels
express order; at which time, the inhabitants shall have two hours | gulliverstravels
warning to keep within doors. | gulliverstravels
“3d, The said man-mountain shall confine his walks to our principal high | gulliverstravels
roads, and not offer to walk, or lie down, in a meadow or field of corn. | gulliverstravels
“4th, As he walks the said roads, he shall take the utmost care not to | gulliverstravels
trample upon the bodies of any of our loving subjects, their horses, or | gulliverstravels
carriages, nor take any of our subjects into his hands without their own | gulliverstravels
consent. | gulliverstravels
“5th, If an express requires extraordinary despatch, the man-mountain | gulliverstravels
shall be obliged to carry, in his pocket, the messenger and horse a six | gulliverstravels
days journey, once in every moon, and return the said messenger back (if | gulliverstravels
so required) safe to our imperial presence. | gulliverstravels
“6th, He shall be our ally against our enemies in the island of Blefuscu, | gulliverstravels
and do his utmost to destroy their fleet, which is now preparing to | gulliverstravels
invade us. | gulliverstravels
“7th, That the said man-mountain shall, at his times of leisure, be | gulliverstravels
aiding and assisting to our workmen, in helping to raise certain great | gulliverstravels
stones, towards covering the wall of the principal park, and other our | gulliverstravels
royal buildings. | gulliverstravels
“8th, That the said man-mountain shall, in two moons’ time, deliver in an | gulliverstravels
exact survey of the circumference of our dominions, by a computation of | gulliverstravels
his own paces round the coast. | gulliverstravels
“Lastly, That, upon his solemn oath to observe all the above articles, | gulliverstravels
the said man-mountain shall have a daily allowance of meat and drink | gulliverstravels
sufficient for the support of 1724 of our subjects, with free access to | gulliverstravels
our royal person, and other marks of our favour.  Given at our palace at | gulliverstravels
Belfaborac, the twelfth day of the ninety-first moon of our reign.” | gulliverstravels
I swore and subscribed to these articles with great cheerfulness and | gulliverstravels
content, although some of them were not so honourable as I could have | gulliverstravels
wished; which proceeded wholly from the malice of Skyresh Bolgolam, the | gulliverstravels
high-admiral: whereupon my chains were immediately unlocked, and I was at | gulliverstravels
full liberty.  The emperor himself, in person, did me the honour to be by | gulliverstravels
at the whole ceremony.  I made my acknowledgements by prostrating myself | gulliverstravels
at his majesty’s feet: but he commanded me to rise; and after many | gulliverstravels
gracious expressions, which, to avoid the censure of vanity, I shall not | gulliverstravels
repeat, he added, “that he hoped I should prove a useful servant, and | gulliverstravels
well deserve all the favours he had already conferred upon me, or might | gulliverstravels
do for the future.” | gulliverstravels
The reader may please to observe, that, in the last article of the | gulliverstravels
recovery of my liberty, the emperor stipulates to allow me a quantity of | gulliverstravels
meat and drink sufficient for the support of 1724 Lilliputians.  Some | gulliverstravels
time after, asking a friend at court how they came to fix on that | gulliverstravels
determinate number, he told me that his majesty’s mathematicians, having | gulliverstravels
taken the height of my body by the help of a quadrant, and finding it to | gulliverstravels
exceed theirs in the proportion of twelve to one, they concluded from the | gulliverstravels
﻿PRIDE AND PREJUDICE | prideandprejudice
By Jane Austen | prideandprejudice
Chapter 1 | prideandprejudice
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession | prideandprejudice
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. | prideandprejudice
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his | prideandprejudice
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds | prideandprejudice
of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property | prideandprejudice
of some one or other of their daughters. | prideandprejudice
“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that | prideandprejudice
Netherfield Park is let at last?” | prideandprejudice
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. | prideandprejudice
“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she | prideandprejudice
told me all about it.” | prideandprejudice
Mr. Bennet made no answer. | prideandprejudice
“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently. | prideandprejudice
“_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.” | prideandprejudice
This was invitation enough. | prideandprejudice
“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken | prideandprejudice
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came | prideandprejudice
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much | prideandprejudice
delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he | prideandprejudice
is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to | prideandprejudice
be in the house by the end of next week.” | prideandprejudice
“What is his name?” | prideandprejudice
“Bingley.” | prideandprejudice
“Is he married or single?” | prideandprejudice
“Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or | prideandprejudice
five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!” | prideandprejudice
“How so? How can it affect them?” | prideandprejudice
“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You | prideandprejudice
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.” | prideandprejudice
“Is that his design in settling here?” | prideandprejudice
“Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he | prideandprejudice
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as | prideandprejudice
soon as he comes.” | prideandprejudice
“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send | prideandprejudice
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are | prideandprejudice
as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the | prideandprejudice
party.” | prideandprejudice
“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but | prideandprejudice
I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five | prideandprejudice
grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.” | prideandprejudice
“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.” | prideandprejudice
“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into | prideandprejudice
the neighbourhood.” | prideandprejudice
“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.” | prideandprejudice
“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would | prideandprejudice
be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to | prideandprejudice
go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no | prideandprejudice
newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to | prideandprejudice
visit him if you do not.” | prideandprejudice
“You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very | prideandprejudice
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my | prideandprejudice
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though | prideandprejudice
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.” | prideandprejudice
“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the | prideandprejudice
others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so | prideandprejudice
good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.” | prideandprejudice
“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are | prideandprejudice
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of | prideandprejudice
quickness than her sisters.” | prideandprejudice
“Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You | prideandprejudice
take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.” | prideandprejudice
“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They | prideandprejudice
are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration | prideandprejudice
these last twenty years at least.” | prideandprejudice
“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.” | prideandprejudice
“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four | prideandprejudice
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.” | prideandprejudice
“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not | prideandprejudice
visit them.” | prideandprejudice
“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them | prideandprejudice
all.” | prideandprejudice
Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, | prideandprejudice
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had | prideandprejudice
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind | prideandprejudice
was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, | prideandprejudice
little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, | prideandprejudice
she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her | prideandprejudice
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news. | prideandprejudice
Chapter 2 | prideandprejudice
Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He | prideandprejudice
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring | prideandprejudice
his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was | prideandprejudice
paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following | prideandprejudice
manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he | prideandprejudice
suddenly addressed her with: | prideandprejudice
“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.” | prideandprejudice
“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother | prideandprejudice
resentfully, “since we are not to visit.” | prideandprejudice
“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the | prideandprejudice
assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.” | prideandprejudice
“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces | prideandprejudice
of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion | prideandprejudice
of her.” | prideandprejudice
“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do | prideandprejudice
not depend on her serving you.” | prideandprejudice
Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain | prideandprejudice
herself, began scolding one of her daughters. | prideandprejudice
“Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little | prideandprejudice
compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.” | prideandprejudice
“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times | prideandprejudice
them ill.” | prideandprejudice
“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is | prideandprejudice
your next ball to be, Lizzy?” | prideandprejudice
“To-morrow fortnight.” | prideandprejudice
“Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back | prideandprejudice
till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, | prideandprejudice
for she will not know him herself.” | prideandprejudice
“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce | prideandprejudice
Mr. Bingley to _her_.” | prideandprejudice
“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him | prideandprejudice
myself; how can you be so teasing?” | prideandprejudice
“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly | prideandprejudice
very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a | prideandprejudice
fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all, | prideandprejudice
Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as | prideandprejudice
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will | prideandprejudice
take it on myself.” | prideandprejudice
The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense, | prideandprejudice
nonsense!” | prideandprejudice
“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do | prideandprejudice
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on | prideandprejudice
them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you, | prideandprejudice
Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read | prideandprejudice
great books and make extracts.” | prideandprejudice
Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how. | prideandprejudice
“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr. | prideandprejudice
Bingley.” | prideandprejudice
“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife. | prideandprejudice
“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If | prideandprejudice
I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called | prideandprejudice
on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we | prideandprejudice
cannot escape the acquaintance now.” | prideandprejudice
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. | prideandprejudice
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy | prideandprejudice
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the | prideandprejudice
while. | prideandprejudice
“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should | prideandprejudice
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to | prideandprejudice
neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a | prideandprejudice
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a | prideandprejudice
word about it till now.” | prideandprejudice
“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and, | prideandprejudice
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife. | prideandprejudice
“What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door was | prideandprejudice
shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; | prideandprejudice
or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so | prideandprejudice
pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but | prideandprejudice
for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ | prideandprejudice
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next | prideandprejudice
ball.” | prideandprejudice
“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the | prideandprejudice
youngest, I'm the tallest.” | prideandprejudice
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would | prideandprejudice
return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to | prideandprejudice
dinner. | prideandprejudice
Chapter 3 | prideandprejudice
Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five | prideandprejudice
daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her | prideandprejudice
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him | prideandprejudice
in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and | prideandprejudice
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at | prideandprejudice
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, | prideandprejudice
Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been | prideandprejudice
delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely | prideandprejudice
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly | prideandprejudice
with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of | prideandprejudice
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively | prideandprejudice
hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained. | prideandprejudice
“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,” | prideandprejudice
 said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well | prideandprejudice
married, I shall have nothing to wish for.” | prideandprejudice
In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about | prideandprejudice
ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being | prideandprejudice
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had | prideandprejudice
heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more | prideandprejudice
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper | prideandprejudice
window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse. | prideandprejudice
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already | prideandprejudice
had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her | prideandprejudice
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley | prideandprejudice
was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable | prideandprejudice
to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite | prideandprejudice
disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town | prideandprejudice
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that | prideandprejudice
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never | prideandprejudice
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears | prideandprejudice
a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get | prideandprejudice
a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley | prideandprejudice
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. | prideandprejudice
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the | prideandprejudice
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only | prideandprejudice
six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when | prideandprejudice
the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five | prideandprejudice
altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and | prideandprejudice
another young man. | prideandprejudice
Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant | prideandprejudice
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women, | prideandprejudice
with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely | prideandprejudice
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention | prideandprejudice
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and | prideandprejudice
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes | prideandprejudice
after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen | prideandprejudice
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he | prideandprejudice
was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great | prideandprejudice
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust | prideandprejudice
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be | prideandprejudice
proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all | prideandprejudice
his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most | prideandprejudice
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared | prideandprejudice
with his friend. | prideandprejudice
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal | prideandprejudice
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, | prideandprejudice
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving | prideandprejudice
one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for | prideandprejudice
themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced | prideandprejudice
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being | prideandprejudice
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in | prideandprejudice
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. | prideandprejudice
His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man | prideandprejudice
in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again. | prideandprejudice
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of | prideandprejudice
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his | prideandprejudice
having slighted one of her daughters. | prideandprejudice
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit | prideandprejudice
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been | prideandprejudice
standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr. | prideandprejudice
Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend | prideandprejudice
to join it. | prideandprejudice
“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you | prideandprejudice
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better | prideandprejudice
dance.” | prideandprejudice
“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am | prideandprejudice
particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this | prideandprejudice
it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not | prideandprejudice
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to | prideandprejudice
stand up with.” | prideandprejudice
“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley, “for a | prideandprejudice
kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in | prideandprejudice
my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see | prideandprejudice
uncommonly pretty.” | prideandprejudice
“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr. | prideandprejudice
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet. | prideandprejudice
“Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one | prideandprejudice
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I | prideandprejudice
dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.” | prideandprejudice
“Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at | prideandprejudice
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said: | prideandprejudice
“She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no | prideandprejudice
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted | prideandprejudice
by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her | prideandprejudice
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.” | prideandprejudice
Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth | prideandprejudice
remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story, | prideandprejudice
however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, | prideandprejudice
playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous. | prideandprejudice
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. | prideandprejudice
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield | prideandprejudice
party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been | prideandprejudice
distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as | prideandprejudice
her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's | prideandprejudice
pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most | prideandprejudice
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been | prideandprejudice
fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they | prideandprejudice
had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good | prideandprejudice
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they | prideandprejudice
were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With | prideandprejudice
a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a | prideandprejudice
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised | prideandprejudice
such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views on | prideandprejudice
the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a | prideandprejudice
different story to hear. | prideandprejudice
“Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most | prideandprejudice
delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. | prideandprejudice
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well | prideandprejudice
she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with | prideandprejudice
her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her | prideandprejudice
twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second | prideandprejudice
time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand | prideandprejudice
up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody | prideandprejudice
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going | prideandprejudice
down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and | prideandprejudice
asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King, | prideandprejudice
and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, | prideandprejudice
and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--” | prideandprejudice
“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently, | prideandprejudice
“he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of | prideandprejudice
his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!” | prideandprejudice
“Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively | prideandprejudice
handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw | prideandprejudice
anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. | prideandprejudice
Hurst's gown--” | prideandprejudice
Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any | prideandprejudice
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch | prideandprejudice
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some | prideandprejudice
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy. | prideandprejudice
“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not | prideandprejudice
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at | prideandprejudice
all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring | prideandprejudice
him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very | prideandprejudice
great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my | prideandprejudice
dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.” | prideandprejudice
Chapter 4 | prideandprejudice
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in | prideandprejudice
her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very | prideandprejudice
much she admired him. | prideandprejudice
“He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible, | prideandprejudice
good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much | prideandprejudice
ease, with such perfect good breeding!” | prideandprejudice
“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought | prideandprejudice
likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.” | prideandprejudice
“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I | prideandprejudice
did not expect such a compliment.” | prideandprejudice
“Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between | prideandprejudice
us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What | prideandprejudice
could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help | prideandprejudice
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman | prideandprejudice
in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is | prideandprejudice
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a | prideandprejudice
stupider person.” | prideandprejudice
“Dear Lizzy!” | prideandprejudice
“Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. | prideandprejudice
You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable | prideandprejudice
in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your | prideandprejudice
life.” | prideandprejudice
“I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak | prideandprejudice
what I think.” | prideandprejudice
“I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_ | prideandprejudice
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of | prideandprejudice
others! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it | prideandprejudice
everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the | prideandprejudice
good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing | prideandprejudice
of the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters, | prideandprejudice
too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.” | prideandprejudice
“Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you | prideandprejudice
converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep | prideandprejudice
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming | prideandprejudice
neighbour in her.” | prideandprejudice
Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at | prideandprejudice
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more | prideandprejudice
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, | prideandprejudice
and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she | prideandprejudice
was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine | prideandprejudice
ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the | prideandprejudice
power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and | prideandprejudice
conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the | prideandprejudice
first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand | prideandprejudice
pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of | prideandprejudice
associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect | prideandprejudice
entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of | prideandprejudice
a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply | prideandprejudice
impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their | prideandprejudice
own had been acquired by trade. | prideandprejudice
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred | prideandprejudice
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an | prideandprejudice
estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and | prideandprejudice
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a | prideandprejudice
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those | prideandprejudice
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the | prideandprejudice
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to | prideandprejudice
purchase. | prideandprejudice
His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, | prideandprejudice
though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no | prideandprejudice
means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had | prideandprejudice
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider | prideandprejudice
his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of | prideandprejudice
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation | prideandprejudice
to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for | prideandprejudice
half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal | prideandprejudice
rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it | prideandprejudice
immediately. | prideandprejudice
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of | prideandprejudice
great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the | prideandprejudice
easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition | prideandprejudice
could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he | prideandprejudice
never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley | prideandprejudice
had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. | prideandprejudice
In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means | prideandprejudice
deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, | prideandprejudice
reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not | prideandprejudice
inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley | prideandprejudice
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually | prideandprejudice
giving offense. | prideandprejudice
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently | prideandprejudice
characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or | prideandprejudice
prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive | prideandprejudice
to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt | prideandprejudice
acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not | prideandprejudice
conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a | prideandprejudice
collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for | prideandprejudice
none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received | prideandprejudice
either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, | prideandprejudice
but she smiled too much. | prideandprejudice
Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired | prideandprejudice
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one | prideandprejudice
whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore | prideandprejudice
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such | prideandprejudice
commendation to think of her as he chose. | prideandprejudice
Chapter 5 | prideandprejudice
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets | prideandprejudice
were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade | prideandprejudice
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the | prideandprejudice
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. | prideandprejudice
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a | prideandprejudice
disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town; | prideandprejudice
and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house | prideandprejudice
about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, | prideandprejudice
where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, | prideandprejudice
unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all | prideandprejudice
the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him | prideandprejudice
supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By | prideandprejudice
nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. | prideandprejudice
James's had made him courteous. | prideandprejudice
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a | prideandprejudice
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest | prideandprejudice
of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was | prideandprejudice
Elizabeth's intimate friend. | prideandprejudice
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over | prideandprejudice
a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly | prideandprejudice
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate. | prideandprejudice
“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with civil | prideandprejudice
self-command to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice.” | prideandprejudice
“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.” | prideandprejudice
“Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be | prideandprejudice
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he | prideandprejudice
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something | prideandprejudice
about Mr. Robinson.” | prideandprejudice
“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not | prideandprejudice
I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton | prideandprejudice
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many | prideandprejudice
pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his | prideandprejudice
answering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, | prideandprejudice
beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'” | prideandprejudice
“Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as | prideandprejudice
if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.” | prideandprejudice
“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said | prideandprejudice
Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, | prideandprejudice
is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.” | prideandprejudice
“I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his | prideandprejudice
ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite | prideandprejudice
a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he | prideandprejudice
sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.” | prideandprejudice
“Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?” said Jane. | prideandprejudice
“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.” | prideandprejudice
“Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he | prideandprejudice
could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at | prideandprejudice
being spoke to.” | prideandprejudice
“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much, | prideandprejudice
unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably | prideandprejudice
agreeable.” | prideandprejudice
“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very | prideandprejudice
agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it | prideandprejudice
was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had | prideandprejudice
heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to | prideandprejudice
the ball in a hack chaise.” | prideandprejudice
“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I | prideandprejudice
wish he had danced with Eliza.” | prideandprejudice
“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_, | prideandprejudice
if I were you.” | prideandprejudice
“I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.” | prideandprejudice
“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride | prideandprejudice
often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so | prideandprejudice
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, | prideandprejudice
should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_ | prideandprejudice
to be proud.” | prideandprejudice
“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive | prideandprejudice
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.” | prideandprejudice
“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her | prideandprejudice
reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have | prideandprejudice
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human | prideandprejudice
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us | prideandprejudice
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some | prideandprejudice
quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different | prideandprejudice
things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may | prideandprejudice
be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of | prideandprejudice
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.” | prideandprejudice
“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with | prideandprejudice
his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of | prideandprejudice
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.” | prideandprejudice
“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs. | prideandprejudice
Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle | prideandprejudice
directly.” | prideandprejudice
The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she | prideandprejudice
would, and the argument ended only with the visit. | prideandprejudice
Chapter 6 | prideandprejudice
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit | prideandprejudice
was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on | prideandprejudice
the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was | prideandprejudice
found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, | prideandprejudice
a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards | prideandprejudice
the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest | prideandprejudice
pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment | prideandprejudice
of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; | prideandprejudice
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in | prideandprejudice
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It | prideandprejudice
was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and | prideandprejudice
to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference | prideandprejudice
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a | prideandprejudice
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it | prideandprejudice
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane | prideandprejudice
united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a | prideandprejudice
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions | prideandprejudice
of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas. | prideandprejudice
“It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose | prideandprejudice
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be | prideandprejudice
so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill | prideandprejudice
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and | prideandprejudice
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in | prideandprejudice
the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every | prideandprejudice
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all | prideandprejudice
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are | prideandprejudice
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without | prideandprejudice
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_ | prideandprejudice
affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he | prideandprejudice
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.” | prideandprejudice
“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can | prideandprejudice
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to | prideandprejudice
discover it too.” | prideandprejudice
“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.” | prideandprejudice
“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal | prideandprejudice
it, he must find it out.” | prideandprejudice
“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane | prideandprejudice
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they | prideandprejudice
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that | prideandprejudice
every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should | prideandprejudice
therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his | prideandprejudice
attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for | prideandprejudice
falling in love as much as she chooses.” | prideandprejudice
“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in | prideandprejudice
question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined | prideandprejudice
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But | prideandprejudice
these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, | prideandprejudice
she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its | prideandprejudice
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four | prideandprejudice
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, | prideandprejudice
and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite | prideandprejudice
enough to make her understand his character.” | prideandprejudice
“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might | prideandprejudice
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must | prideandprejudice
remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four | prideandprejudice
evenings may do a great deal.” | prideandprejudice
“Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they | prideandprejudice
both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other | prideandprejudice
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.” | prideandprejudice
“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and | prideandprejudice
if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a | prideandprejudice
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a | prideandprejudice
twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If | prideandprejudice
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or | prideandprejudice
ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the | prideandprejudice
least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to | prideandprejudice
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as | prideandprejudice
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your | prideandprejudice
life.” | prideandprejudice
“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not | prideandprejudice
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.” | prideandprejudice
Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth | prideandprejudice
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some | prideandprejudice
interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely | prideandprejudice
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the | prideandprejudice
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no | prideandprejudice
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly | prideandprejudice
had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered | prideandprejudice
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To | prideandprejudice
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had | prideandprejudice
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry | prideandprejudice
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and | prideandprejudice
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those | prideandprejudice
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of | prideandprejudice
this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made | prideandprejudice
himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough | prideandprejudice
to dance with. | prideandprejudice
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing | prideandprejudice
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so | prideandprejudice
drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were | prideandprejudice
assembled. | prideandprejudice
“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my | prideandprejudice
conversation with Colonel Forster?” | prideandprejudice
“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.” | prideandprejudice
“But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see | prideandprejudice
what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by | prideandprejudice
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.” | prideandprejudice
On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have | prideandprejudice
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such | prideandprejudice
a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she | prideandprejudice
turned to him and said: | prideandprejudice
“Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly | prideandprejudice
well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at | prideandprejudice
Meryton?” | prideandprejudice
“With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady | prideandprejudice
energetic.” | prideandprejudice
“You are severe on us.” | prideandprejudice
“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going | prideandprejudice
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.” | prideandprejudice
“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me | prideandprejudice
to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken | prideandprejudice
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would | prideandprejudice
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of | prideandprejudice
hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, | prideandprejudice
she added, “Very well, if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing | prideandprejudice
at Mr. Darcy, “There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of | prideandprejudice
course familiar with: 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and I | prideandprejudice
shall keep mine to swell my song.” | prideandprejudice
Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song | prideandprejudice
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that | prideandprejudice
she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her | prideandprejudice
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in | prideandprejudice
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always | prideandprejudice
impatient for display. | prideandprejudice
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her | prideandprejudice
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited | prideandprejudice
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she | prideandprejudice
had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with | prideandprejudice
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the | prideandprejudice
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by | prideandprejudice
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, | prideandprejudice
with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in | prideandprejudice
dancing at one end of the room. | prideandprejudice
Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of | prideandprejudice
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too | prideandprejudice
much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was | prideandprejudice
his neighbour, till Sir William thus began: | prideandprejudice
“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There | prideandprejudice
is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first | prideandprejudice
refinements of polished society.” | prideandprejudice
“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst | prideandprejudice
the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.” | prideandprejudice
Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he | prideandprejudice
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt | prideandprejudice
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.” | prideandprejudice
“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.” | prideandprejudice
“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do | prideandprejudice
you often dance at St. James's?” | prideandprejudice
“Never, sir.” | prideandprejudice
“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?” | prideandprejudice
“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.” | prideandprejudice
“You have a house in town, I conclude?” | prideandprejudice
Mr. Darcy bowed. | prideandprejudice
“I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond | prideandprejudice
of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of | prideandprejudice
London would agree with Lady Lucas.” | prideandprejudice
He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed | prideandprejudice
to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was | prideandprejudice
struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to | prideandprejudice
her: | prideandprejudice
“My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow | prideandprejudice
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You | prideandprejudice
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.” | prideandprejudice
 And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though | prideandprejudice
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly | prideandprejudice
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William: | prideandprejudice
“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you | prideandprejudice
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.” | prideandprejudice
Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of | prideandprejudice
her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at | prideandprejudice
all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion. | prideandprejudice
“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny | prideandprejudice
me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the | prideandprejudice
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us | prideandprejudice
for one half-hour.” | prideandprejudice
“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling. | prideandprejudice
“He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, | prideandprejudice
we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a | prideandprejudice
partner?” | prideandprejudice
Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not | prideandprejudice
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some | prideandprejudice
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley: | prideandprejudice
“I can guess the subject of your reverie.” | prideandprejudice
“I should imagine not.” | prideandprejudice
“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings | prideandprejudice
in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion. | prideandprejudice
I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the | prideandprejudice
nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would | prideandprejudice
I give to hear your strictures on them!” | prideandprejudice
“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more | prideandprejudice
agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure | prideandprejudice
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.” | prideandprejudice
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he | prideandprejudice
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. | prideandprejudice
Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity: | prideandprejudice
“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.” | prideandprejudice
“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment. | prideandprejudice
How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you | prideandprejudice
joy?” | prideandprejudice
“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's | prideandprejudice
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love | prideandprejudice
to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.” | prideandprejudice
“Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is | prideandprejudice
absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed; | prideandprejudice
and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.” | prideandprejudice
He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to | prideandprejudice
entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her | prideandprejudice
that all was safe, her wit flowed long. | prideandprejudice
Chapter 7 | prideandprejudice
Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two | prideandprejudice
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, | prideandprejudice
in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's | prideandprejudice
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply | prideandprejudice
the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and | prideandprejudice
had left her four thousand pounds. | prideandprejudice
She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to | prideandprejudice
their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in | prideandprejudice
London in a respectable line of trade. | prideandprejudice
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most | prideandprejudice
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted | prideandprejudice
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and | prideandprejudice
to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, | prideandprejudice
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; | prideandprejudice
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing | prideandprejudice
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning | prideandprejudice
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news | prideandprejudice
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some | prideandprejudice
from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with | prideandprejudice
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the | prideandprejudice
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the | prideandprejudice
headquarters. | prideandprejudice
Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most | prideandprejudice
interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge | prideandprejudice
of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a | prideandprejudice
secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. | prideandprejudice
Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of | prideandprejudice
felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and | prideandprejudice
Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation | prideandprejudice
to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the | prideandprejudice
regimentals of an ensign. | prideandprejudice
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. | prideandprejudice
Bennet coolly observed: | prideandprejudice
“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two | prideandprejudice
of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but | prideandprejudice
I am now convinced.” | prideandprejudice
Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect | prideandprejudice
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, | prideandprejudice
and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the | prideandprejudice
next morning to London. | prideandprejudice
“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so | prideandprejudice
ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly | prideandprejudice
of anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however.” | prideandprejudice
“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.” | prideandprejudice
“Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.” | prideandprejudice
“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I | prideandprejudice
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must | prideandprejudice
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly | prideandprejudice
foolish.” | prideandprejudice
“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of | prideandprejudice
their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will | prideandprejudice
not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when | prideandprejudice
I liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my | prideandprejudice
heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, | prideandprejudice
should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought | prideandprejudice
Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in | prideandprejudice
his regimentals.” | prideandprejudice
“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain | prideandprejudice
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first | prideandprejudice
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library.” | prideandprejudice
Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with | prideandprejudice
a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited | prideandprejudice
for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was | prideandprejudice
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read, | prideandprejudice
“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well, | prideandprejudice
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.” | prideandprejudice
“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud. | prideandprejudice
“MY DEAR FRIEND,-- | prideandprejudice
“If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, | prideandprejudice
we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, | prideandprejudice
for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a | prideandprejudice
quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the | prideandprejudice
gentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever, | prideandprejudice
“CAROLINE BINGLEY” | prideandprejudice
“With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of | prideandprejudice
_that_.” | prideandprejudice
“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.” | prideandprejudice
“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane. | prideandprejudice
“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to | prideandprejudice
rain; and then you must stay all night.” | prideandprejudice
“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that | prideandprejudice
they would not offer to send her home.” | prideandprejudice
“Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton, | prideandprejudice
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.” | prideandprejudice
“I had much rather go in the coach.” | prideandprejudice
“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are | prideandprejudice
wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?” | prideandprejudice
“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.” | prideandprejudice
“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother's purpose | prideandprejudice
will be answered.” | prideandprejudice
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses | prideandprejudice
were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her | prideandprejudice
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a | prideandprejudice
bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before | prideandprejudice
it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was | prideandprejudice
delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; | prideandprejudice
Jane certainly could not come back. | prideandprejudice
“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet more than | prideandprejudice
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the | prideandprejudice
next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her | prideandprejudice
contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield | prideandprejudice
brought the following note for Elizabeth: | prideandprejudice
“MY DEAREST LIZZY,-- | prideandprejudice
“I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be | prideandprejudice
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not | prideandprejudice
hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr. | prideandprejudice
Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been | prideandprejudice
to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the | prideandprejudice
matter with me.--Yours, etc.” | prideandprejudice
“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note | prideandprejudice
aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she | prideandprejudice
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of | prideandprejudice
Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.” | prideandprejudice
“Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling | prideandprejudice
colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is | prideandprejudice
all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.” | prideandprejudice
Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though | prideandprejudice
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking | prideandprejudice
was her only alternative. She declared her resolution. | prideandprejudice
“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a | prideandprejudice
thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get | prideandprejudice
there.” | prideandprejudice
“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.” | prideandprejudice
“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the | prideandprejudice
horses?” | prideandprejudice
“No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing | prideandprejudice
when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.” | prideandprejudice
“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every | prideandprejudice
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, | prideandprejudice
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.” | prideandprejudice
“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia. | prideandprejudice
Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off | prideandprejudice
together. | prideandprejudice
“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may | prideandprejudice
see something of Captain Carter before he goes.” | prideandprejudice
In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one | prideandprejudice
of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing | prideandprejudice
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing | prideandprejudice
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last | prideandprejudice
within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face | prideandprejudice
glowing with the warmth of exercise. | prideandprejudice
She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were | prideandprejudice
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. | prideandprejudice
That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such | prideandprejudice
dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and | prideandprejudice
Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt | prideandprejudice
for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their | prideandprejudice
brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there | prideandprejudice
was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. | prideandprejudice
Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the | prideandprejudice
brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as | prideandprejudice
to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was | prideandprejudice
thinking only of his breakfast. | prideandprejudice
Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss | prideandprejudice
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not | prideandprejudice
well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her | prideandprejudice
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving | prideandprejudice
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed | prideandprejudice
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, | prideandprejudice
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them | prideandprejudice
together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the | prideandprejudice
extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended | prideandprejudice
her. | prideandprejudice
When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth | prideandprejudice
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and | prideandprejudice
solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having | prideandprejudice
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught | prideandprejudice
a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; | prideandprejudice
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice | prideandprejudice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head | prideandprejudice
ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were | prideandprejudice
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in | prideandprejudice
fact, nothing to do elsewhere. | prideandprejudice
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very | prideandprejudice
unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only | prideandprejudice
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern | prideandprejudice
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer | prideandprejudice
of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. | prideandprejudice
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to | prideandprejudice
Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply | prideandprejudice
of clothes. | prideandprejudice
Chapter 8 | prideandprejudice
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six | prideandprejudice
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then | prideandprejudice
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the | prideandprejudice
much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very | prideandprejudice
favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing | prideandprejudice
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how | prideandprejudice
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked | prideandprejudice
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their | prideandprejudice
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored | prideandprejudice
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike. | prideandprejudice
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could | prideandprejudice
regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his | prideandprejudice
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling | prideandprejudice
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the | prideandprejudice
others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was | prideandprejudice
engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. | prideandprejudice
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to | prideandprejudice
eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain | prideandprejudice
dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her. | prideandprejudice
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley | prideandprejudice
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were | prideandprejudice
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; | prideandprejudice
she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the | prideandprejudice
same, and added: | prideandprejudice
“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent | prideandprejudice
walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really | prideandprejudice
looked almost wild.” | prideandprejudice
“She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very | prideandprejudice
nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the | prideandprejudice
country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!” | prideandprejudice
“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep | prideandprejudice
in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to | prideandprejudice
hide it not doing its office.” | prideandprejudice
“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was | prideandprejudice
all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably | prideandprejudice
well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite | prideandprejudice
escaped my notice.” | prideandprejudice
“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am | prideandprejudice
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such | prideandprejudice
an exhibition.” | prideandprejudice
“Certainly not.” | prideandprejudice
“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, | prideandprejudice
above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by | prideandprejudice
it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, | prideandprejudice
a most country-town indifference to decorum.” | prideandprejudice
“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said | prideandprejudice
Bingley. | prideandprejudice
“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, “that | prideandprejudice
this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.” | prideandprejudice
“Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” A | prideandprejudice
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again: | prideandprejudice
“I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very | prideandprejudice
sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with | prideandprejudice
such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is | prideandprejudice
no chance of it.” | prideandprejudice
“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in | prideandprejudice
Meryton.” | prideandprejudice
“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.” | prideandprejudice
“That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily. | prideandprejudice
“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it | prideandprejudice
would not make them one jot less agreeable.” | prideandprejudice
“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any | prideandprejudice
consideration in the world,” replied Darcy. | prideandprejudice
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their | prideandprejudice
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of | prideandprejudice
their dear friend's vulgar relations. | prideandprejudice
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on | prideandprejudice
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. | prideandprejudice
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till | prideandprejudice
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and | prideandprejudice
when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go | prideandprejudice
downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole | prideandprejudice
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting | prideandprejudice
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the | prideandprejudice
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay | prideandprejudice
below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment. | prideandprejudice
“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.” | prideandprejudice
“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great | prideandprejudice
reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.” | prideandprejudice
“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I am | prideandprejudice
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.” | prideandprejudice
“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and | prideandprejudice
I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.” | prideandprejudice
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the | prideandprejudice
table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her | prideandprejudice
others--all that his library afforded. | prideandprejudice
“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own | prideandprejudice
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more | prideandprejudice
than I ever looked into.” | prideandprejudice
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those | prideandprejudice
in the room. | prideandprejudice
“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left | prideandprejudice
so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at | prideandprejudice
Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!” | prideandprejudice
“It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many | prideandprejudice
generations.” | prideandprejudice
“And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying | prideandprejudice
books.” | prideandprejudice
“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as | prideandprejudice
these.” | prideandprejudice
“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of | prideandprejudice
that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be | prideandprejudice
half as delightful as Pemberley.” | prideandprejudice
“I wish it may.” | prideandprejudice
“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that | prideandprejudice
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a | prideandprejudice
finer county in England than Derbyshire.” | prideandprejudice
“With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.” | prideandprejudice
“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.” | prideandprejudice
“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get | prideandprejudice
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.” | prideandprejudice
Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very | prideandprejudice
little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew | prideandprejudice
near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his | prideandprejudice
eldest sister, to observe the game. | prideandprejudice
“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley; “will | prideandprejudice
she be as tall as I am?” | prideandprejudice
“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or | prideandprejudice
rather taller.” | prideandprejudice
“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me | prideandprejudice
so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished | prideandprejudice
for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.” | prideandprejudice
﻿CHAPTER I | dracula
JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL | dracula
(_Kept in shorthand._) | dracula
_3 May. Bistritz._--Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at | dracula
Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an | dracula
hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I | dracula
got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the | dracula
streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived | dracula
late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The | dracula
impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the | dracula
East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is | dracula
here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish | dracula
rule. | dracula
We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. | dracula
Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or | dracula
rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was | dracula
very good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the | dracula
waiter, and he said it was called "paprika hendl," and that, as it was a | dracula
national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the | dracula
Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I | dracula
don't know how I should be able to get on without it. | dracula
Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the | dracula
British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library | dracula
regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the | dracula
country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a | dracula
nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the | dracula
extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, | dracula
Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian | dracula
mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was | dracula
not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the | dracula
Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare | dracula
with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post | dracula
town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter | dracula
here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my | dracula
travels with Mina. | dracula
In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities: | dracula
Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the | dracula
descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the | dracula
East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended | dracula
from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered | dracula
the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I | dracula
read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the | dracula
horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of | dracula
imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_Mem._, I | dracula
must ask the Count all about them.) | dracula
I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had | dracula
all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my | dracula
window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been | dracula
the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was | dracula
still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous | dracula
knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then. | dracula
I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour | dracula
which they said was "mamaliga," and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a | dracula
very excellent dish, which they call "impletata." (_Mem._, get recipe | dracula
for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little | dracula
before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to | dracula
the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour | dracula
before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the | dracula
more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China? | dracula
All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of | dracula
beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the | dracula
top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by | dracula
rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side | dracula
of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and | dracula
running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every | dracula
station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts | dracula
of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I | dracula
saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats | dracula
and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women | dracula
looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy | dracula
about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other, | dracula
and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something | dracula
fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there | dracula
were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the | dracula
Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy | dracula
hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous | dracula
heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass | dracula
nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and | dracula
had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very | dracula
picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be | dracula
set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are, | dracula
however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural | dracula
self-assertion. | dracula
It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a | dracula
very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the | dracula
Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy | dracula
existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series | dracula
of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate | dracula
occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent | dracula
a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war | dracula
proper being assisted by famine and disease. | dracula
Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I | dracula
found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of | dracula
course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was | dracula
evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a | dracula
cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white | dracula
undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff | dracula
fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and | dracula
said, "The Herr Englishman?" "Yes," I said, "Jonathan Harker." She | dracula
smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves, | dracula
who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with | dracula
a letter:-- | dracula
     "My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting | dracula
     you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will | dracula
     start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo | dracula
     Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust | dracula
     that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you | dracula
     will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land. | dracula
"Your friend, | dracula
"DRACULA." | dracula
_4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count, | dracula
directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on | dracula
making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and | dracula
pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be | dracula
true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he | dracula
answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old | dracula
lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of | dracula
way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that | dracula
was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could | dracula
tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves, | dracula
and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak | dracula
further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask | dracula
any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means | dracula
comforting. | dracula
Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a | dracula
very hysterical way: | dracula
"Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?" She was in such an excited | dracula
state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and | dracula
mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I | dracula
was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her | dracula
that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business, | dracula
she asked again: | dracula
"Do you know what day it is?" I answered that it was the fourth of May. | dracula
She shook her head as she said again: | dracula
"Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?" On | dracula
my saying that I did not understand, she went on: | dracula
"It is the eve of St. George's Day. Do you not know that to-night, when | dracula
the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have | dracula
full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?" | dracula
She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but | dracula
without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not | dracula
to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very | dracula
ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business | dracula
to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore | dracula
tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked | dracula
her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and | dracula
dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I | dracula
did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been | dracula
taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it | dracula
seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a | dracula
state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the | dracula
rosary round my neck, and said, "For your mother's sake," and went out | dracula
of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting | dracula
for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still | dracula
round my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly | dracula
traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I | dracula
am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should | dracula
ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the | dracula
coach! | dracula
       *       *       *       *       * | dracula
_5 May. The Castle._--The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is | dracula
high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or | dracula
hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are | dracula
mixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake, | dracula
naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put | dracula
down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I | dracula
left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they | dracula
called "robber steak"--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red | dracula
pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple | dracula
style of the London cat's meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which | dracula
produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not | dracula
disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else. | dracula
When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him | dracula
talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every | dracula
now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting | dracula
on the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning | dracula
"word-bearer"--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them | dracula
pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for | dracula
there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot | dracula
dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not | dracula
cheering to me, for amongst them were "Ordog"--Satan, "pokol"--hell, | dracula
"stregoica"--witch, "vrolok" and "vlkoslak"--both of which mean the same | dracula
thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is | dracula
either were-wolf or vampire. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count about these | dracula
superstitions) | dracula
When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time | dracula
swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and | dracula
pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a | dracula
fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at | dracula
first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a | dracula
charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me, | dracula
just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one | dracula
seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I | dracula
could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I | dracula
had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing | dracula
themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of | dracula
rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the | dracula
centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered | dracula
the whole front of the box-seat--"gotza" they call them--cracked his big | dracula
whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on | dracula
our journey. | dracula
I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the | dracula
scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather | dracula
languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have | dracula
been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping | dracula
land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned | dracula
with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the | dracula
road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple, | dracula
plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under | dracula
the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these | dracula
green hills of what they call here the "Mittel Land" ran the road, | dracula
losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the | dracula
straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the | dracula
hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we | dracula
seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then | dracula
what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no | dracula
time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime | dracula
excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter | dracula
snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in | dracula
the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept | dracula
in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the | dracula
Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, | dracula
and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point. | dracula
Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes | dracula
of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right | dracula
and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon | dracula
them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, | dracula
deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where | dracula
grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and | dracula
pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where | dracula
the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the | dracula
mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again | dracula
the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as | dracula
we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered | dracula
peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to | dracula
be right before us:-- | dracula
"Look! Isten szek!"--"God's seat!"--and he crossed himself reverently. | dracula
As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind | dracula
us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was | dracula
emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the | dracula
sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there | dracula
we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed | dracula
that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses, | dracula
and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there | dracula
was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even | dracula
turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of | dracula
devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were | dracula
many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here | dracula
and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems | dracula
shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and | dracula
again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant's cart--with its | dracula
long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the | dracula
road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming | dracula
peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their | dracula
coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long | dracula
staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold, | dracula
and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the | dracula
gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which | dracula
ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the | dracula
Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of | dracula
late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods | dracula
that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of | dracula
greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a | dracula
peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and | dracula
grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset | dracula
threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the | dracula
Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the | dracula
hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could | dracula
only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home, | dracula
but the driver would not hear of it. "No, no," he said; "you must not | dracula
walk here; the dogs are too fierce"; and then he added, with what he | dracula
evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the | dracula
approving smile of the rest--"and you may have enough of such matters | dracula
before you go to sleep." The only stop he would make was a moment's | dracula
pause to light his lamps. | dracula
When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the | dracula
passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as | dracula
though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully | dracula
with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on | dracula
to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of | dracula
patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the | dracula
hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach | dracula
rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a | dracula
stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared | dracula
to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each | dracula
side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One | dracula
by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed | dracula
upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were | dracula
certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good | dracula
faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of | dracula
fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at | dracula
Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye. | dracula
Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the | dracula
passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the | dracula
darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either | dracula
happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would | dracula
give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for | dracula
some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on | dracula
the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the | dracula
air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the | dracula
mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got | dracula
into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance | dracula
which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the | dracula
glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light | dracula
was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our | dracula
hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy | dracula
road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle. | dracula
The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock | dracula
my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when | dracula
the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I | dracula
could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I | dracula
thought it was "An hour less than the time." Then turning to me, he said | dracula
in German worse than my own:-- | dracula
"There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will | dracula
now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better | dracula
the next day." Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and | dracula
snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then, | dracula
amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing | dracula
of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook | dracula
us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our | dracula
lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and | dracula
splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown | dracula
beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I | dracula
could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red | dracula
in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:-- | dracula
"You are early to-night, my friend." The man stammered in reply:-- | dracula
"The English Herr was in a hurry," to which the stranger replied:-- | dracula
"That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot | dracula
deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift." As he | dracula
spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with | dracula
very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my | dracula
companions whispered to another the line from Burger's "Lenore":-- | dracula
    "Denn die Todten reiten schnell"-- | dracula
    ("For the dead travel fast.") | dracula
The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a | dracula
gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time | dracula
putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. "Give me the Herr's | dracula
luggage," said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were | dracula
handed out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the | dracula
coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a | dracula
hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been | dracula
prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we | dracula
swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam | dracula
from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected | dracula
against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then | dracula
the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept | dracula
on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a | dracula
strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown | dracula
over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in | dracula
excellent German:-- | dracula
"The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all | dracula
care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the | dracula
country) underneath the seat, if you should require it." I did not take | dracula
any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a | dracula
little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been | dracula
any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that | dracula
unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along, | dracula
then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It | dracula
seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground | dracula
again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was | dracula
so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but | dracula
I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any | dracula
protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to | dracula
delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was | dracula
passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was | dracula
within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I | dracula
suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my | dracula
recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense. | dracula
Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a | dracula
long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by | dracula
another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which | dracula
now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed | dracula
to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp | dracula
it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to | dracula
strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they | dracula
quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from | dracula
sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each | dracula
side of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which | dracula
affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to | dracula
jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged | dracula
madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them | dracula
from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to | dracula
the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able | dracula
to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and | dracula
whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers | dracula
doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became | dracula
quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again | dracula
took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This | dracula
time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a | dracula
narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right. | dracula
Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the | dracula
roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning | dracula
rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we | dracula
could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the | dracula
rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along. | dracula
It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall, | dracula
so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The | dracula
keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew | dracula
fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer | dracula
and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I | dracula
grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, | dracula
however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to | dracula
left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness. | dracula
Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The | dracula
driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and, | dracula
jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know | dracula
what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while | dracula
I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took | dracula
his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep | dracula
and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated | dracula
endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare. | dracula
Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness | dracula
around us I could watch the driver's motions. He went rapidly to where | dracula
the blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem | dracula
to illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones, | dracula
formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical | dracula
effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it, | dracula
for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but | dracula
as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me | dracula
straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue | dracula
flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the | dracula
wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle. | dracula
At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he | dracula
had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse | dracula
than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause | dracula
for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just | dracula
then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the | dracula
jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw | dracula
around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues, | dracula
with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more | dracula
terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled. | dracula
For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man | dracula
feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand | dracula
their true import. | dracula
All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had | dracula
some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and | dracula
looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see; | dracula
but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they | dracula
had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for | dracula
it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the | dracula
ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the | dracula
calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as | dracula
to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know | dracula
not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and | dracula
looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his | dracula
long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves | dracula
fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across | dracula
the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness. | dracula
When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the | dracula
wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a | dracula
dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time | dracula
seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete | dracula
darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on | dracula
ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main | dracula
always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the | dracula
driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a | dracula
vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, | dracula
and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit | dracula
sky. | dracula
CHAPTER II | dracula
JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL--_continued_ | dracula
_5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully | dracula
awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In | dracula
the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark | dracula
ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than | dracula
it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight. | dracula
When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand | dracula
to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious | dracula
strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have | dracula
crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed | dracula
them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and | dracula
studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of | dracula
massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was | dracula
massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and | dracula
weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the | dracula
reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one | dracula
of the dark openings. | dracula
I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell | dracula
or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark | dracula
window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The | dracula
time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon | dracula
me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people? | dracula
What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a | dracula
customary incident in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent out to | dracula
explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor's | dracula
clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving | dracula
London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a | dracula
full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if | dracula
I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I | dracula
expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with | dracula
the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt | dracula
in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the | dracula
pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake | dracula
and among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to | dracula
wait the coming of the morning. | dracula
Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching | dracula
behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming | dracula
light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of | dracula
massive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise | dracula
of long disuse, and the great door swung back. | dracula
Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white | dracula
moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck | dracula
of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver | dracula
lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind, | dracula
throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the | dracula
open door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly | dracula
gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:-- | dracula
"Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!" He made no | dracula
motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his | dracula
gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that | dracula
I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and | dracula
holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince, | dracula
an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as | dracula
ice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:-- | dracula
"Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the | dracula
happiness you bring!" The strength of the handshake was so much akin to | dracula
that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that | dracula
for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was | dracula
speaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:-- | dracula
"Count Dracula?" He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:-- | dracula
"I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in; | dracula
the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest." As he was | dracula
speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out, | dracula
took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I | dracula
protested but he insisted:-- | dracula
"Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not | dracula
available. Let me see to your comfort myself." He insisted on carrying | dracula
my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and | dracula
along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang | dracula
heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced | dracula
to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper, | dracula
and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished, | dracula
flamed and flared. | dracula
The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing | dracula
the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit | dracula
by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing | dracula
through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a | dracula
welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with | dracula
another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were | dracula
fresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself | dracula
left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the | dracula
door:-- | dracula
"You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your | dracula
toilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come | dracula
into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared." | dracula
The light and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome seemed to have | dracula
dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state, | dracula
I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty | dracula
toilet, I went into the other room. | dracula
I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the | dracula
great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of | dracula
his hand to the table, and said:-- | dracula
"I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse | dracula
me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup." | dracula
I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me. | dracula
He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed | dracula
it to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of | dracula
pleasure. | dracula
"I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant | dracula
sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to | dracula
come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in | dracula
whom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy | dracula
and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is | dracula
discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall | dracula
be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take | dracula
your instructions in all matters." | dracula
The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I | dracula
fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese | dracula
and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was | dracula
my supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many | dracula
questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had | dracula
experienced. | dracula
By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host's desire had drawn | dracula
up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me, | dracula
at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an | dracula
opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked | dracula
physiognomy. | dracula
His face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the | dracula
thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and | dracula
hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His | dracula
eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy | dracula
hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I | dracula
could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather | dracula
cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over | dracula
the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a | dracula
man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops | dracula
extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm | dracula
though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor. | dracula
Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees | dracula
in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing | dracula
them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather | dracula
coarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in | dracula
the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp | dracula
point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not | dracula
repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a | dracula
horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could | dracula
not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a | dracula
grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his | dracula
protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the | dracula
fireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the | dracula
window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a | dracula
strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from | dracula
down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count's eyes | dracula
gleamed, and he said:-- | dracula
"Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!" | dracula
Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he | dracula
added:-- | dracula
"Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the | dracula
hunter." Then he rose and said:-- | dracula
"But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you | dracula
shall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon; | dracula
so sleep well and dream well!" With a courteous bow, he opened for me | dracula
himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom.... | dracula
I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things, | dracula
which I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the | dracula
sake of those dear to me! | dracula
       *       *       *       *       * | dracula
_7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the | dracula
last twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my | dracula
own accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had | dracula
supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the | dracula
pot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which | dracula
was written:-- | dracula
"I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D." I set to and | dracula
enjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I | dracula
might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one. | dracula
There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the | dracula
extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service | dracula
is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value. | dracula
The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of | dracula
my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have | dracula
been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old, | dracula
though in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court, | dracula
but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of | dracula
the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my | dracula
table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I | dracula
could either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant | dracula
anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves. | dracula
Some time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it | dracula
breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o'clock when I had | dracula
it--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about | dracula
the castle until I had asked the Count's permission. There was | dracula
absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing | dracula
materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of | dracula
library. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked. | dracula
In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English | dracula
books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and | dracula
newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines | dracula
and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books | dracula
were of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political | dracula
economy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life | dracula
and customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the | dracula
London Directory, the "Red" and "Blue" books, Whitaker's Almanac, the | dracula
Army and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the | dracula
Law List. | dracula
Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count | dracula
entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good | dracula
night's rest. Then he went on:-- | dracula
"I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that | dracula
will interest you. These companions"--and he laid his hand on some of | dracula
the books--"have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever | dracula
since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours | dracula
of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to | dracula
know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of | dracula
your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of | dracula
humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes | dracula
it what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books. | dracula
To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak." | dracula
"But, Count," I said, "you know and speak English thoroughly!" He bowed | dracula
gravely. | dracula
"I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I | dracula
fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know | dracula
the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them." | dracula
"Indeed," I said, "you speak excellently." | dracula
"Not so," he answered. "Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your | dracula
London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not | dracula
enough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me, | dracula
and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men | dracula
know him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am | dracula
like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his | dracula
speaking if he hear my words, 'Ha, ha! a stranger!' I have been so long | dracula
master that I would be master still--or at least that none other should | dracula
be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter | dracula
Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You | dracula
shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may | dracula
learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make | dracula
error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be | dracula
away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many | dracula
important affairs in hand." | dracula
Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might | dracula
come into that room when I chose. He answered: "Yes, certainly," and | dracula
added:-- | dracula
"You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are | dracula
locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that | dracula
all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with | dracula
my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand." I said I was sure of | dracula
this, and then he went on:-- | dracula
"We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are | dracula
not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from | dracula
what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of | dracula
what strange things there may be." | dracula
This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to | dracula
talk, if only for talking's sake, I asked him many questions regarding | dracula
things that had already happened to me or come within my notice. | dracula
Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by | dracula
pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most | dracula
frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked | dracula
him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for | dracula
instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue | dracula
flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a | dracula
certain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits | dracula
are supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place | dracula
where treasure has been concealed. "That treasure has been hidden," he | dracula
went on, "in the region through which you came last night, there can be | dracula
but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the | dracula
Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil | dracula
in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men, | dracula
patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the | dracula
Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out | dracula
to meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited | dracula
their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep | dracula
destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader | dracula
was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been | dracula
sheltered in the friendly soil." | dracula
"But how," said I, "can it have remained so long undiscovered, when | dracula
there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?" | dracula
The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long, | dracula
sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:-- | dracula
"Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only | dracula
appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he | dracula
can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he | dracula
would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who | dracula
marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight | dracula
even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to | dracula
find these places again?" | dracula
"There you are right," I said. "I know no more than the dead where even | dracula
to look for them." Then we drifted into other matters. | dracula
"Come," he said at last, "tell me of London and of the house which you | dracula
have procured for me." With an apology for my remissness, I went into my | dracula
own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in | dracula
order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I | dracula
passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp | dracula
lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit | dracula
in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa, | dracula
reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw's Guide. When I | dracula
came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I | dracula
went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in | dracula
everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its | dracula
surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the | dracula
subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much | dracula
more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:-- | dracula
"Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there | dracula
I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I | dracula
fall into my country's habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend | dracula
Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be | dracula
in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my | dracula
other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!" | dracula
We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at | dracula
Purfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the | dracula
necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to | dracula
Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a | dracula
place. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I | dracula
inscribe here:-- | dracula
"At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to | dracula
be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place | dracula
was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure, | dracula
built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of | dracula
years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with | dracula
rust. | dracula
"The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre | dracula
Face_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of | dracula
the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by | dracula
the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which | dracula
make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or | dracula
small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and | dracula
flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all | dracula
periods back, I should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stone | dracula
immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with | dracula
iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or | dracula
church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading | dracula
to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from | dracula
various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling | dracula
way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must | dracula
be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very | dracula
large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic | dracula
asylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds." | dracula
When I had finished, he said:-- | dracula
"I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to | dracula
live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a | dracula
day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice | dracula
also that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love | dracula
not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not | dracula
gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and | dracula
sparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young; | dracula
and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not | dracula
attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the | dracula
shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken | dracula
battlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would | dracula
be alone with my thoughts when I may." Somehow his words and his look | dracula
did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his | dracula
smile look malignant and saturnine. | dracula
Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers | dracula
together. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of | dracula
the books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at | dracula
England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in | dracula
certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed | dracula
that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new | dracula
estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the | dracula
Yorkshire coast. | dracula
It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. "Aha!" he | dracula
said; "still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I | dracula
am informed that your supper is ready." He took my arm, and we went into | dracula
the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The | dracula
Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from | dracula
home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate. | dracula
After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with | dracula
me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour | dracula
after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not | dracula
say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host's wishes in | dracula
every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified | dracula
me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at | dracula
the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide. | dracula
They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to | dracula
the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and | dracula
tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere | dracula
can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up | dracula
with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count | dracula
Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:-- | dracula
"Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so | dracula
long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of | dracula
England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by | dracula
us," and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me. | dracula
I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to | dracula
notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the | dracula
warm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have | dracula
written of this day. | dracula
       *       *       *       *       * | dracula
_8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too | dracula
diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for | dracula
there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I | dracula
cannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had | dracula
never come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on | dracula
me; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I | dracula
could bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with, | dracula
and he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let | dracula
me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and | dracula
imagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say | dracula
at once how I stand--or seem to. | dracula
I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could | dracula
not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window, | dracula
and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, | dracula
and heard the Count's voice saying to me, "Good-morning." I started, for | dracula
it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass | dracula
covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly, | dracula
but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count's | dracula
salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken. | dracula
This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I | dracula
could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in | dracula
the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no | dracula
sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on | dracula
the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague | dracula
feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at | dracula
the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was | dracula
trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half | dracula
round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his | dracula
eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at | dracula
my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which | dracula
held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed | dracula
so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there. | dracula
"Take care," he said, "take care how you cut yourself. It is more | dracula
dangerous than you think in this country." Then seizing the shaving | dracula
glass, he went on: "And this is the wretched thing that has done the | dracula
mischief. It is a foul bauble of man's vanity. Away with it!" and | dracula
opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung | dracula
out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones | dracula
of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very | dracula
annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or | dracula
the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal. | dracula
When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could | dracula
not find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that | dracula
as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very | dracula
peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I | dracula
went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The | dracula
view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity | dracula
of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A | dracula
stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without | dracula
touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree | dracula
tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and | dracula
there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through | dracula
the forests. | dracula
But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I | dracula
explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and | dracula
bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there | dracula
an available exit. | dracula
The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner! | dracula
CHAPTER III | dracula
JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL--_continued_ | dracula
When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me. | dracula
I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of | dracula
every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my | dracula
helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a | dracula
few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much | dracula
as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me | dracula
that I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done | dracula
anything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. I | dracula
am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of | dracula
one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to | dracula
the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it | dracula
himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive | dracula
me if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only | dracula
plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes | dracula
open. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears, | dracula
or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and | dracula
shall need, all my brains to get through. | dracula
I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below | dracula
shut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into | dracula
the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making | dracula
the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along | dracula
thought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him | dracula
through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the | dracula
dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these | dracula
menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them. | dracula
This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it | dracula
must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that | dracula
brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it | dracula
mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his | dracula
hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the | dracula
coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the | dracula
crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless | dracula
that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a | dracula
comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing | dracula
which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous | dracula
should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there | dracula
is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium, | dracula
a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some | dracula
time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my | dracula
mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count | dracula
Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of | dracula
himself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful, | dracula
however, not to awake his suspicion. | dracula
       *       *       *       *       * | dracula
_Midnight._--I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few | dracula
questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject | dracula
wonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of | dracula
battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he | dracula
afterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house | dracula
and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their | dracula
fate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said "we," | dracula
and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put | dracula
down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most | dracula
fascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He | dracula
grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great | dracula
white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as | dracula
though he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I | dracula
shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of | dracula
his race:-- | dracula
"We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood | dracula
of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here, | dracula
in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from | dracula
Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their | dracula
Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay, | dracula
and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the | dracula
were-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found | dracula
the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame, | dracula
till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those | dracula
old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the | dracula
desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as | dracula
Attila, whose blood is in these veins?" He held up his arms. "Is it a | dracula
wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the | dracula
Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his | dracula
thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when | dracula
Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us | dracula
here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed | dracula
there? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were | dracula
claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries | dracula
was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more | dracula
than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say, | dracula
'water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.' Who more gladly than we | dracula
throughout the Four Nations received the 'bloody sword,' or at its | dracula
warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was | dracula
redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the | dracula
flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who | dracula
was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat | dracula
the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that | dracula
his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the | dracula
Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula, | dracula
indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and | dracula
again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who, | dracula
when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had | dracula
to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being | dracula
slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They | dracula
said that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants | dracula
without a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to | dracula
conduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Mohács, we threw off the | dracula
Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for | dracula
our spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the | dracula
Szekelys--and the Dracula as their heart's blood, their brains, and | dracula
their swords--can boast a record that mushroom growths like the | dracula
Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over. | dracula
Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and | dracula

TREASURE ISLAND | treasureisland
PART ONE--The Old Buccaneer | treasureisland
1 | treasureisland
The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral Benbow | treasureisland
SQUIRE TRELAWNEY, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having | treasureisland
asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from | treasureisland
the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the | treasureisland
island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I | treasureisland
take up my pen in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time when | treasureisland
my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the | treasureisland
sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof. | treasureisland
I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the | treasureisland
inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow--a | treasureisland
tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the | treasureisland
shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with | treasureisland
black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid | treasureisland
white. I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself | treasureisland
as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so | treasureisland
often afterwards: | treasureisland
          “Fifteen men on the dead man's chest-- | treasureisland
             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!” | treasureisland
in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and | treasureisland
broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of | treasureisland
stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared, | treasureisland
called roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him, | treasureisland
he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still | treasureisland
looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard. | treasureisland
“This is a handy cove,” says he at length; “and a pleasant sittyated | treasureisland
grog-shop. Much company, mate?” | treasureisland
My father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity. | treasureisland
“Well, then,” said he, “this is the berth for me. Here you, matey,” he | treasureisland
cried to the man who trundled the barrow; “bring up alongside and help | treasureisland
up my chest. I'll stay here a bit,” he continued. “I'm a plain man; rum | treasureisland
and bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch | treasureisland
ships off. What you mought call me? You mought call me captain. Oh, I | treasureisland
see what you're at--there”; and he threw down three or four gold pieces | treasureisland
on the threshold. “You can tell me when I've worked through that,” says | treasureisland
he, looking as fierce as a commander. | treasureisland
And indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke, he had none | treasureisland
of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but seemed like | treasureisland
a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike. The man who came | treasureisland
with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at | treasureisland
the Royal George, that he had inquired what inns there were along the | treasureisland
coast, and hearing ours well spoken of, I suppose, and described as | treasureisland
lonely, had chosen it from the others for his place of residence. And | treasureisland
that was all we could learn of our guest. | treasureisland
He was a very silent man by custom. All day he hung round the cove or | treasureisland
upon the cliffs with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a corner | treasureisland
of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong. Mostly | treasureisland
he would not speak when spoken to, only look up sudden and fierce and | treasureisland
blow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people who came | treasureisland
about our house soon learned to let him be. Every day when he came back | treasureisland
from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the | treasureisland
road. At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind | treasureisland
that made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was | treasureisland
desirous to avoid them. When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow | treasureisland
(as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol) he | treasureisland
would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the | treasureisland
parlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such | treasureisland
was present. For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter, for | treasureisland
I was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms. He had taken me aside one day | treasureisland
and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I | treasureisland
would only keep my “weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg” | treasureisland
 and let him know the moment he appeared. Often enough when the first | treasureisland
of the month came round and I applied to him for my wage, he would only | treasureisland
blow through his nose at me and stare me down, but before the week was | treasureisland
out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four-penny piece, and | treasureisland
repeat his orders to look out for “the seafaring man with one leg.” | treasureisland
How that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you. On | treasureisland
stormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house and | treasureisland
the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see him in a | treasureisland
thousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions. Now the leg | treasureisland
would be cut off at the knee, now at the hip; now he was a monstrous | treasureisland
kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg, and that in the | treasureisland
middle of his body. To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and | treasureisland
ditch was the worst of nightmares. And altogether I paid pretty dear for | treasureisland
my monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies. | treasureisland
But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one | treasureisland
leg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who | treasureisland
knew him. There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water | treasureisland
than his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his | treasureisland
wicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would call | treasureisland
for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his | treasureisland
stories or bear a chorus to his singing. Often I have heard the house | treasureisland
shaking with “Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum,” all the neighbours joining | treasureisland
in for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing | treasureisland
louder than the other to avoid remark. For in these fits he was the most | treasureisland
overriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table for | treasureisland
silence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question, | treasureisland
or sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was not | treasureisland
following his story. Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he | treasureisland
had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed. | treasureisland
His stories were what frightened people worst of all. Dreadful stories | treasureisland
they were--about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and | treasureisland
the Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main. By his | treasureisland
own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men | treasureisland
that God ever allowed upon the sea, and the language in which he told | treasureisland
these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the | treasureisland
crimes that he described. My father was always saying the inn would be | treasureisland
ruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over | treasureisland
and put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his | treasureisland
presence did us good. People were frightened at the time, but on looking | treasureisland
back they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country | treasureisland
life, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to | treasureisland
admire him, calling him a “true sea-dog” and a “real old salt” and | treasureisland
such like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made England | treasureisland
terrible at sea. | treasureisland
In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week | treasureisland
after week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had | treasureisland
been long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to | treasureisland
insist on having more. If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through | treasureisland
his nose so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my poor | treasureisland
father out of the room. I have seen him wringing his hands after such a | treasureisland
rebuff, and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have | treasureisland
greatly hastened his early and unhappy death. | treasureisland
All the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his | treasureisland
dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker. One of the cocks of his | treasureisland
hat having fallen down, he let it hang from that day forth, though it | treasureisland
was a great annoyance when it blew. I remember the appearance of his | treasureisland
coat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before | treasureisland
the end, was nothing but patches. He never wrote or received a letter, | treasureisland
and he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these, for the | treasureisland
most part, only when drunk on rum. The great sea-chest none of us had | treasureisland
ever seen open. | treasureisland
He was only once crossed, and that was towards the end, when my poor | treasureisland
father was far gone in a decline that took him off. Dr. Livesey came | treasureisland
late one afternoon to see the patient, took a bit of dinner from my | treasureisland
mother, and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should | treasureisland
come down from the hamlet, for we had no stabling at the old Benbow. I | treasureisland
followed him in, and I remember observing the contrast the neat, bright | treasureisland
doctor, with his powder as white as snow and his bright, black eyes and | treasureisland
pleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all, | treasureisland
with that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting, | treasureisland
far gone in rum, with his arms on the table. Suddenly he--the captain, | treasureisland
that is--began to pipe up his eternal song: | treasureisland
          “Fifteen men on the dead man's chest-- | treasureisland
             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! | treasureisland
           Drink and the devil had done for the rest-- | treasureisland
             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!” | treasureisland
At first I had supposed “the dead man's chest” to be that identical big | treasureisland
box of his upstairs in the front room, and the thought had been mingled | treasureisland
in my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man. But by this | treasureisland
time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it | treasureisland
was new, that night, to nobody but Dr. Livesey, and on him I observed it | treasureisland
did not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite | treasureisland
angrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on | treasureisland
a new cure for the rheumatics. In the meantime, the captain gradually | treasureisland
brightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon | treasureisland
the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence. The voices | treasureisland
stopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey's; he went on as before speaking | treasureisland
clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or | treasureisland
two. The captain glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again, | treasureisland
glared still harder, and at last broke out with a villainous, low oath, | treasureisland
“Silence, there, between decks!” | treasureisland
“Were you addressing me, sir?” says the doctor; and when the ruffian had | treasureisland
told him, with another oath, that this was so, “I have only one thing to | treasureisland
say to you, sir,” replies the doctor, “that if you keep on drinking rum, | treasureisland
the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel!” | treasureisland
The old fellow's fury was awful. He sprang to his feet, drew and opened | treasureisland
a sailor's clasp-knife, and balancing it open on the palm of his hand, | treasureisland
threatened to pin the doctor to the wall. | treasureisland
The doctor never so much as moved. He spoke to him as before, over his | treasureisland
shoulder and in the same tone of voice, rather high, so that all the | treasureisland
room might hear, but perfectly calm and steady: “If you do not put that | treasureisland
knife this instant in your pocket, I promise, upon my honour, you shall | treasureisland
hang at the next assizes.” | treasureisland
Then followed a battle of looks between them, but the captain soon | treasureisland
knuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed his seat, grumbling like | treasureisland
a beaten dog. | treasureisland
“And now, sir,” continued the doctor, “since I now know there's such a | treasureisland
fellow in my district, you may count I'll have an eye upon you day and | treasureisland
night. I'm not a doctor only; I'm a magistrate; and if I catch a breath | treasureisland
of complaint against you, if it's only for a piece of incivility like | treasureisland
tonight's, I'll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed | treasureisland
out of this. Let that suffice.” | treasureisland
Soon after, Dr. Livesey's horse came to the door and he rode away, but | treasureisland
the captain held his peace that evening, and for many evenings to come. | treasureisland

Black Dog Appears and Disappears | treasureisland
IT was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the | treasureisland
mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you | treasureisland
will see, of his affairs. It was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard | treasureisland
frosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor | treasureisland
father was little likely to see the spring. He sank daily, and my mother | treasureisland
and I had all the inn upon our hands, and were kept busy enough without | treasureisland
paying much regard to our unpleasant guest. | treasureisland
It was one January morning, very early--a pinching, frosty morning--the | treasureisland
cove all grey with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping softly on the stones, | treasureisland
the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to | treasureisland
seaward. The captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the | treasureisland
beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat, | treasureisland
his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. I | treasureisland
remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and | treasureisland
the last sound I heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort | treasureisland
of indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr. Livesey. | treasureisland
Well, mother was upstairs with father and I was laying the | treasureisland
breakfast-table against the captain's return when the parlour door | treasureisland
opened and a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before. He | treasureisland
was a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand, and | treasureisland
though he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter. I | treasureisland
had always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and I | treasureisland
remember this one puzzled me. He was not sailorly, and yet he had a | treasureisland
smack of the sea about him too. | treasureisland
I asked him what was for his service, and he said he would take rum; but | treasureisland
as I was going out of the room to fetch it, he sat down upon a table | treasureisland
and motioned me to draw near. I paused where I was, with my napkin in my | treasureisland
hand. | treasureisland
“Come here, sonny,” says he. “Come nearer here.” | treasureisland
I took a step nearer. | treasureisland
“Is this here table for my mate Bill?” he asked with a kind of leer. | treasureisland
I told him I did not know his mate Bill, and this was for a person who | treasureisland
stayed in our house whom we called the captain. | treasureisland
“Well,” said he, “my mate Bill would be called the captain, as like | treasureisland
as not. He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him, | treasureisland
particularly in drink, has my mate Bill. We'll put it, for argument | treasureisland
like, that your captain has a cut on one cheek--and we'll put it, if you | treasureisland
like, that that cheek's the right one. Ah, well! I told you. Now, is my | treasureisland
mate Bill in this here house?” | treasureisland
I told him he was out walking. | treasureisland
“Which way, sonny? Which way is he gone?” | treasureisland
And when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was | treasureisland
likely to return, and how soon, and answered a few other questions, | treasureisland
“Ah,” said he, “this'll be as good as drink to my mate Bill.” | treasureisland
The expression of his face as he said these words was not at all | treasureisland
pleasant, and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was | treasureisland
mistaken, even supposing he meant what he said. But it was no affair of | treasureisland
mine, I thought; and besides, it was difficult to know what to do. The | treasureisland
stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door, peering round the | treasureisland
corner like a cat waiting for a mouse. Once I stepped out myself into | treasureisland
the road, but he immediately called me back, and as I did not obey quick | treasureisland
enough for his fancy, a most horrible change came over his tallowy face, | treasureisland
and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump. As soon as I | treasureisland
was back again he returned to his former manner, half fawning, half | treasureisland
sneering, patted me on the shoulder, told me I was a good boy and he had | treasureisland
taken quite a fancy to me. “I have a son of my own,” said he, “as like | treasureisland
you as two blocks, and he's all the pride of my 'art. But the great | treasureisland
thing for boys is discipline, sonny--discipline. Now, if you had sailed | treasureisland
along of Bill, you wouldn't have stood there to be spoke to twice--not | treasureisland
you. That was never Bill's way, nor the way of sich as sailed with him. | treasureisland
And here, sure enough, is my mate Bill, with a spy-glass under his arm, | treasureisland
bless his old 'art, to be sure. You and me'll just go back into the | treasureisland
parlour, sonny, and get behind the door, and we'll give Bill a little | treasureisland
surprise--bless his 'art, I say again.” | treasureisland
So saying, the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me | treasureisland
behind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door. I | treasureisland
was very uneasy and alarmed, as you may fancy, and it rather added to my | treasureisland
fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself. He | treasureisland
cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath; | treasureisland
and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt | treasureisland
what we used to call a lump in the throat. | treasureisland
At last in strode the captain, slammed the door behind him, without | treasureisland
looking to the right or left, and marched straight across the room to | treasureisland
where his breakfast awaited him. | treasureisland
“Bill,” said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried to make | treasureisland
bold and big. | treasureisland
The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all the brown had | treasureisland
gone out of his face, and even his nose was blue; he had the look of a | treasureisland
man who sees a ghost, or the evil one, or something worse, if anything | treasureisland
can be; and upon my word, I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn | treasureisland
so old and sick. | treasureisland
“Come, Bill, you know me; you know an old shipmate, Bill, surely,” said | treasureisland
the stranger. | treasureisland
The captain made a sort of gasp. | treasureisland
“Black Dog!” said he. | treasureisland
“And who else?” returned the other, getting more at his ease. “Black | treasureisland
Dog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate Billy, at the Admiral | treasureisland
Benbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, since | treasureisland
I lost them two talons,” holding up his mutilated hand. | treasureisland
“Now, look here,” said the captain; “you've run me down; here I am; | treasureisland
well, then, speak up; what is it?” | treasureisland
“That's you, Bill,” returned Black Dog, “you're in the right of it, | treasureisland
Billy. I'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here, as I've took | treasureisland
such a liking to; and we'll sit down, if you please, and talk square, | treasureisland
like old shipmates.” | treasureisland
When I returned with the rum, they were already seated on either side | treasureisland
of the captain's breakfast-table--Black Dog next to the door and | treasureisland
sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as I | treasureisland
thought, on his retreat. | treasureisland
He bade me go and leave the door wide open. “None of your keyholes for | treasureisland
me, sonny,” he said; and I left them together and retired into the bar. | treasureisland
For a long time, though I certainly did my best to listen, I could hear | treasureisland
nothing but a low gattling; but at last the voices began to grow higher, | treasureisland
and I could pick up a word or two, mostly oaths, from the captain. | treasureisland
“No, no, no, no; and an end of it!” he cried once. And again, “If it | treasureisland
comes to swinging, swing all, say I.” | treasureisland
Then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and | treasureisland
other noises--the chair and table went over in a lump, a clash of steel | treasureisland
followed, and then a cry of pain, and the next instant I saw Black | treasureisland
Dog in full flight, and the captain hotly pursuing, both with drawn | treasureisland
cutlasses, and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder. Just | treasureisland
at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous | treasureisland
cut, which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been | treasureisland
intercepted by our big signboard of Admiral Benbow. You may see the | treasureisland
notch on the lower side of the frame to this day. | treasureisland
That blow was the last of the battle. Once out upon the road, Black | treasureisland
Dog, in spite of his wound, showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and | treasureisland
disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute. The captain, for | treasureisland
his part, stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man. Then he | treasureisland
passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into | treasureisland
the house. | treasureisland
“Jim,” says he, “rum”; and as he spoke, he reeled a little, and caught | treasureisland
himself with one hand against the wall. | treasureisland
“Are you hurt?” cried I. | treasureisland
“Rum,” he repeated. “I must get away from here. Rum! Rum!” | treasureisland
I ran to fetch it, but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen | treasureisland
out, and I broke one glass and fouled the tap, and while I was still | treasureisland
getting in my own way, I heard a loud fall in the parlour, and running | treasureisland
in, beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor. At the same | treasureisland
instant my mother, alarmed by the cries and fighting, came running | treasureisland
downstairs to help me. Between us we raised his head. He was breathing | treasureisland
very loud and hard, but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible | treasureisland
colour. | treasureisland
“Dear, deary me,” cried my mother, “what a disgrace upon the house! And | treasureisland
your poor father sick!” | treasureisland
In the meantime, we had no idea what to do to help the captain, nor any | treasureisland
other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with | treasureisland
the stranger. I got the rum, to be sure, and tried to put it down his | treasureisland
throat, but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron. | treasureisland
It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey | treasureisland
came in, on his visit to my father. | treasureisland
“Oh, doctor,” we cried, “what shall we do? Where is he wounded?” | treasureisland
“Wounded? A fiddle-stick's end!” said the doctor. “No more wounded than | treasureisland
you or I. The man has had a stroke, as I warned him. Now, Mrs. Hawkins, | treasureisland
just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him, if possible, nothing | treasureisland
about it. For my part, I must do my best to save this fellow's trebly | treasureisland
worthless life; Jim, you get me a basin.” | treasureisland
When I got back with the basin, the doctor had already ripped up the | treasureisland
captain's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm. It was tattooed | treasureisland
in several places. “Here's luck,” “A fair wind,” and “Billy Bones his | treasureisland
fancy,” were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up | treasureisland
near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from | treasureisland
it--done, as I thought, with great spirit. | treasureisland
“Prophetic,” said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger. | treasureisland
“And now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we'll have a look at | treasureisland
the colour of your blood. Jim,” he said, “are you afraid of blood?” | treasureisland
“No, sir,” said I. | treasureisland
“Well, then,” said he, “you hold the basin”; and with that he took his | treasureisland
lancet and opened a vein. | treasureisland
A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes | treasureisland
and looked mistily about him. First he recognized the doctor with | treasureisland
an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked | treasureisland
relieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise | treasureisland
himself, crying, “Where's Black Dog?” | treasureisland
“There is no Black Dog here,” said the doctor, “except what you have | treasureisland
on your own back. You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke, | treasureisland
precisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will, | treasureisland
dragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones--” | treasureisland
“That's not my name,” he interrupted. | treasureisland
“Much I care,” returned the doctor. “It's the name of a buccaneer of my | treasureisland
acquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what I | treasureisland
have to say to you is this; one glass of rum won't kill you, but if | treasureisland
you take one you'll take another and another, and I stake my wig if you | treasureisland
don't break off short, you'll die--do you understand that?--die, and go | treasureisland
to your own place, like the man in the Bible. Come, now, make an effort. | treasureisland
I'll help you to your bed for once.” | treasureisland
Between us, with much trouble, we managed to hoist him upstairs, and | treasureisland
laid him on his bed, where his head fell back on the pillow as if he | treasureisland
were almost fainting. | treasureisland
“Now, mind you,” said the doctor, “I clear my conscience--the name of | treasureisland
rum for you is death.” | treasureisland
And with that he went off to see my father, taking me with him by the | treasureisland
arm. | treasureisland
“This is nothing,” he said as soon as he had closed the door. “I have | treasureisland
drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile; he should lie for a week | treasureisland
where he is--that is the best thing for him and you; but another stroke | treasureisland
would settle him.” | treasureisland
3 | treasureisland
The Black Spot | treasureisland
ABOUT noon I stopped at the captain's door with some cooling drinks | treasureisland
and medicines. He was lying very much as we had left him, only a little | treasureisland
higher, and he seemed both weak and excited. | treasureisland
“Jim,” he said, “you're the only one here that's worth anything, and you | treasureisland
know I've been always good to you. Never a month but I've given you a | treasureisland
silver fourpenny for yourself. And now you see, mate, I'm pretty low, | treasureisland
and deserted by all; and Jim, you'll bring me one noggin of rum, now, | treasureisland
won't you, matey?” | treasureisland
“The doctor--” I began. | treasureisland
But he broke in cursing the doctor, in a feeble voice but heartily. | treasureisland
“Doctors is all swabs,” he said; “and that doctor there, why, what do | treasureisland
he know about seafaring men? I been in places hot as pitch, and mates | treasureisland
dropping round with Yellow Jack, and the blessed land a-heaving like the | treasureisland
sea with earthquakes--what to the doctor know of lands like that?--and I | treasureisland
lived on rum, I tell you. It's been meat and drink, and man and wife, | treasureisland
to me; and if I'm not to have my rum now I'm a poor old hulk on a lee | treasureisland
shore, my blood'll be on you, Jim, and that doctor swab”; and he ran on | treasureisland
again for a while with curses. “Look, Jim, how my fingers fidges,” | treasureisland
 he continued in the pleading tone. “I can't keep 'em still, not I. I | treasureisland
haven't had a drop this blessed day. That doctor's a fool, I tell you. | treasureisland
If I don't have a drain o' rum, Jim, I'll have the horrors; I seen some | treasureisland
on 'em already. I seen old Flint in the corner there, behind you; as | treasureisland
plain as print, I seen him; and if I get the horrors, I'm a man that | treasureisland
has lived rough, and I'll raise Cain. Your doctor hisself said one glass | treasureisland
wouldn't hurt me. I'll give you a golden guinea for a noggin, Jim.” | treasureisland
He was growing more and more excited, and this alarmed me for my father, | treasureisland
who was very low that day and needed quiet; besides, I was reassured by | treasureisland
the doctor's words, now quoted to me, and rather offended by the offer | treasureisland
of a bribe. | treasureisland
“I want none of your money,” said I, “but what you owe my father. I'll | treasureisland
get you one glass, and no more.” | treasureisland
When I brought it to him, he seized it greedily and drank it out. | treasureisland
“Aye, aye,” said he, “that's some better, sure enough. And now, matey, | treasureisland
did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?” | treasureisland
“A week at least,” said I. | treasureisland
“Thunder!” he cried. “A week! I can't do that; they'd have the black | treasureisland
spot on me by then. The lubbers is going about to get the wind of me | treasureisland
this blessed moment; lubbers as couldn't keep what they got, and want to | treasureisland
nail what is another's. Is that seamanly behaviour, now, I want to know? | treasureisland
But I'm a saving soul. I never wasted good money of mine, nor lost it | treasureisland
neither; and I'll trick 'em again. I'm not afraid on 'em. I'll shake out | treasureisland
another reef, matey, and daddle 'em again.” | treasureisland
As he was thus speaking, he had risen from bed with great difficulty, | treasureisland
holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out, and | treasureisland
moving his legs like so much dead weight. His words, spirited as they | treasureisland
were in meaning, contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in | treasureisland
which they were uttered. He paused when he had got into a sitting | treasureisland
position on the edge. | treasureisland
“That doctor's done me,” he murmured. “My ears is singing. Lay me back.” | treasureisland
Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his | treasureisland
former place, where he lay for a while silent. | treasureisland
“Jim,” he said at length, “you saw that seafaring man today?” | treasureisland
“Black Dog?” I asked. | treasureisland
“Ah! Black Dog,” says he. “HE'S a bad un; but there's worse that put him | treasureisland
on. Now, if I can't get away nohow, and they tip me the black spot, mind | treasureisland
you, it's my old sea-chest they're after; you get on a horse--you can, | treasureisland
can't you? Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to--well, yes, | treasureisland
I will!--to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all | treasureisland
hands--magistrates and sich--and he'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral | treasureisland
Benbow--all old Flint's crew, man and boy, all on 'em that's left. I was | treasureisland
first mate, I was, old Flint's first mate, and I'm the on'y one as knows | treasureisland
the place. He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if I | treasureisland
was to now, you see. But you won't peach unless they get the black spot | treasureisland
on me, or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with | treasureisland
one leg, Jim--him above all.” | treasureisland
“But what is the black spot, captain?” I asked. | treasureisland
“That's a summons, mate. I'll tell you if they get that. But you keep | treasureisland
your weather-eye open, Jim, and I'll share with you equals, upon my | treasureisland
honour.” | treasureisland
He wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but soon after I | treasureisland
had given him his medicine, which he took like a child, with the remark, | treasureisland
“If ever a seaman wanted drugs, it's me,” he fell at last into a heavy, | treasureisland
swoon-like sleep, in which I left him. What I should have done had all | treasureisland
gone well I do not know. Probably I should have told the whole story to | treasureisland
the doctor, for I was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of | treasureisland
his confessions and make an end of me. But as things fell out, my poor | treasureisland
father died quite suddenly that evening, which put all other matters | treasureisland
on one side. Our natural distress, the visits of the neighbours, the | treasureisland
arranging of the funeral, and all the work of the inn to be carried on | treasureisland
in the meanwhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think of | treasureisland
the captain, far less to be afraid of him. | treasureisland
He got downstairs next morning, to be sure, and had his meals as usual, | treasureisland
though he ate little and had more, I am afraid, than his usual supply of | treasureisland
rum, for he helped himself out of the bar, scowling and blowing through | treasureisland
his nose, and no one dared to cross him. On the night before the funeral | treasureisland
he was as drunk as ever; and it was shocking, in that house of mourning, | treasureisland
to hear him singing away at his ugly old sea-song; but weak as he was, | treasureisland
we were all in the fear of death for him, and the doctor was suddenly | treasureisland
taken up with a case many miles away and was never near the house after | treasureisland
my father's death. I have said the captain was weak, and indeed he | treasureisland
seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength. He clambered up | treasureisland
and down stairs, and went from the parlour to the bar and back again, | treasureisland
and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea, holding on to | treasureisland
the walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a man | treasureisland
on a steep mountain. He never particularly addressed me, and it is my | treasureisland
belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences; but his temper was | treasureisland
more flighty, and allowing for his bodily weakness, more violent than | treasureisland
ever. He had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his | treasureisland
cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table. But with all that, | treasureisland
he minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather | treasureisland
wandering. Once, for instance, to our extreme wonder, he piped up to a | treasureisland
different air, a kind of country love-song that he must have learned in | treasureisland
his youth before he had begun to follow the sea. | treasureisland
So things passed until, the day after the funeral, and about three | treasureisland
o'clock of a bitter, foggy, frosty afternoon, I was standing at the door | treasureisland
for a moment, full of sad thoughts about my father, when I saw someone | treasureisland
drawing slowly near along the road. He was plainly blind, for he tapped | treasureisland
before him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and | treasureisland
nose; and he was hunched, as if with age or weakness, and wore a huge | treasureisland
old tattered sea-cloak with a hood that made him appear positively | treasureisland
deformed. I never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking figure. | treasureisland
He stopped a little from the inn, and raising his voice in an odd | treasureisland
sing-song, addressed the air in front of him, “Will any kind friend | treasureisland
inform a poor blind man, who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in | treasureisland
the gracious defence of his native country, England--and God bless King | treasureisland
George!--where or in what part of this country he may now be?” | treasureisland
“You are at the Admiral Benbow, Black Hill Cove, my good man,” said I. | treasureisland
“I hear a voice,” said he, “a young voice. Will you give me your hand, | treasureisland
my kind young friend, and lead me in?” | treasureisland
I held out my hand, and the horrible, soft-spoken, eyeless creature | treasureisland
gripped it in a moment like a vise. I was so much startled that I | treasureisland
struggled to withdraw, but the blind man pulled me close up to him with | treasureisland
a single action of his arm. | treasureisland
“Now, boy,” he said, “take me in to the captain.” | treasureisland
“Sir,” said I, “upon my word I dare not.” | treasureisland
“Oh,” he sneered, “that's it! Take me in straight or I'll break your | treasureisland
arm.” | treasureisland
And he gave it, as he spoke, a wrench that made me cry out. | treasureisland
“Sir,” said I, “it is for yourself I mean. The captain is not what he | treasureisland
used to be. He sits with a drawn cutlass. Another gentleman--” | treasureisland
“Come, now, march,” interrupted he; and I never heard a voice so cruel, | treasureisland
and cold, and ugly as that blind man's. It cowed me more than the pain, | treasureisland
and I began to obey him at once, walking straight in at the door and | treasureisland
towards the parlour, where our sick old buccaneer was sitting, dazed | treasureisland
with rum. The blind man clung close to me, holding me in one iron fist | treasureisland
and leaning almost more of his weight on me than I could carry. “Lead me | treasureisland
straight up to him, and when I'm in view, cry out, 'Here's a friend | treasureisland
for you, Bill.' If you don't, I'll do this,” and with that he gave me a | treasureisland
twitch that I thought would have made me faint. Between this and that, I | treasureisland
was so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that I forgot my terror of | treasureisland
the captain, and as I opened the parlour door, cried out the words he | treasureisland
had ordered in a trembling voice. | treasureisland
The poor captain raised his eyes, and at one look the rum went out of | treasureisland
him and left him staring sober. The expression of his face was not so | treasureisland
much of terror as of mortal sickness. He made a movement to rise, but I | treasureisland
do not believe he had enough force left in his body. | treasureisland
“Now, Bill, sit where you are,” said the beggar. “If I can't see, I can | treasureisland
hear a finger stirring. Business is business. Hold out your left hand. | treasureisland
Boy, take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right.” | treasureisland
We both obeyed him to the letter, and I saw him pass something from the | treasureisland
hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captain's, | treasureisland
which closed upon it instantly. | treasureisland
“And now that's done,” said the blind man; and at the words he suddenly | treasureisland
left hold of me, and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness, | treasureisland
skipped out of the parlour and into the road, where, as I still stood | treasureisland
motionless, I could hear his stick go tap-tap-tapping into the distance. | treasureisland
It was some time before either I or the captain seemed to gather our | treasureisland
senses, but at length, and about at the same moment, I released his | treasureisland
wrist, which I was still holding, and he drew in his hand and looked | treasureisland
sharply into the palm. | treasureisland
“Ten o'clock!” he cried. “Six hours. We'll do them yet,” and he sprang | treasureisland
to his feet. | treasureisland
Even as he did so, he reeled, put his hand to his throat, stood swaying | treasureisland
for a moment, and then, with a peculiar sound, fell from his whole | treasureisland
height face foremost to the floor. | treasureisland
I ran to him at once, calling to my mother. But haste was all in vain. | treasureisland
The captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy. It is a curious | treasureisland
thing to understand, for I had certainly never liked the man, though of | treasureisland
late I had begun to pity him, but as soon as I saw that he was dead, I | treasureisland
burst into a flood of tears. It was the second death I had known, and | treasureisland
the sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart. | treasureisland
4 | treasureisland
The Sea-chest | treasureisland
I LOST no time, of course, in telling my mother all that I knew, and | treasureisland
perhaps should have told her long before, and we saw ourselves at once | treasureisland
in a difficult and dangerous position. Some of the man's money--if | treasureisland
he had any--was certainly due to us, but it was not likely that our | treasureisland
captain's shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by me, Black | treasureisland
Dog and the blind beggar, would be inclined to give up their booty in | treasureisland
payment of the dead man's debts. The captain's order to mount at | treasureisland
once and ride for Doctor Livesey would have left my mother alone | treasureisland
and unprotected, which was not to be thought of. Indeed, it seemed | treasureisland
impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house; the fall | treasureisland
of coals in the kitchen grate, the very ticking of the clock, filled | treasureisland
us with alarms. The neighbourhood, to our ears, seemed haunted by | treasureisland
approaching footsteps; and what between the dead body of the captain | treasureisland
on the parlour floor and the thought of that detestable blind beggar | treasureisland
hovering near at hand and ready to return, there were moments when, as | treasureisland
the saying goes, I jumped in my skin for terror. Something must speedily | treasureisland
be resolved upon, and it occurred to us at last to go forth together | treasureisland
and seek help in the neighbouring hamlet. No sooner said than done. | treasureisland
Bare-headed as we were, we ran out at once in the gathering evening and | treasureisland
the frosty fog. | treasureisland
The hamlet lay not many hundred yards away, though out of view, on the | treasureisland
other side of the next cove; and what greatly encouraged me, it was | treasureisland
in an opposite direction from that whence the blind man had made his | treasureisland
appearance and whither he had presumably returned. We were not many | treasureisland
minutes on the road, though we sometimes stopped to lay hold of each | treasureisland
other and hearken. But there was no unusual sound--nothing but the low | treasureisland
wash of the ripple and the croaking of the inmates of the wood. | treasureisland
It was already candle-light when we reached the hamlet, and I shall | treasureisland
never forget how much I was cheered to see the yellow shine in doors and | treasureisland
windows; but that, as it proved, was the best of the help we were likely | treasureisland
to get in that quarter. For--you would have thought men would have been | treasureisland
ashamed of themselves--no soul would consent to return with us to the | treasureisland
Admiral Benbow. The more we told of our troubles, the more--man, woman, | treasureisland
and child--they clung to the shelter of their houses. The name of | treasureisland
Captain Flint, though it was strange to me, was well enough known to | treasureisland
some there and carried a great weight of terror. Some of the men who | treasureisland
had been to field-work on the far side of the Admiral Benbow remembered, | treasureisland
besides, to have seen several strangers on the road, and taking them to | treasureisland
be smugglers, to have bolted away; and one at least had seen a little | treasureisland
lugger in what we called Kitt's Hole. For that matter, anyone who was a | treasureisland
comrade of the captain's was enough to frighten them to death. And the | treasureisland
short and the long of the matter was, that while we could get several | treasureisland
who were willing enough to ride to Dr. Livesey's, which lay in another | treasureisland
direction, not one would help us to defend the inn. | treasureisland
They say cowardice is infectious; but then argument is, on the other | treasureisland
hand, a great emboldener; and so when each had said his say, my mother | treasureisland
made them a speech. She would not, she declared, lose money that | treasureisland
belonged to her fatherless boy; “If none of the rest of you dare,” | treasureisland
 she said, “Jim and I dare. Back we will go, the way we came, and small | treasureisland
thanks to you big, hulking, chicken-hearted men. We'll have that chest | treasureisland
open, if we die for it. And I'll thank you for that bag, Mrs. Crossley, | treasureisland
to bring back our lawful money in.” | treasureisland
Of course I said I would go with my mother, and of course they all cried | treasureisland
out at our foolhardiness, but even then not a man would go along with | treasureisland
us. All they would do was to give me a loaded pistol lest we were | treasureisland
attacked, and to promise to have horses ready saddled in case we were | treasureisland
pursued on our return, while one lad was to ride forward to the doctor's | treasureisland
in search of armed assistance. | treasureisland
My heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon | treasureisland
this dangerous venture. A full moon was beginning to rise and peered | treasureisland
redly through the upper edges of the fog, and this increased our haste, | treasureisland
for it was plain, before we came forth again, that all would be as | treasureisland
bright as day, and our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers. | treasureisland
We slipped along the hedges, noiseless and swift, nor did we see or hear | treasureisland
anything to increase our terrors, till, to our relief, the door of the | treasureisland
Admiral Benbow had closed behind us. | treasureisland
I slipped the bolt at once, and we stood and panted for a moment in the | treasureisland
dark, alone in the house with the dead captain's body. Then my mother | treasureisland
got a candle in the bar, and holding each other's hands, we advanced | treasureisland
into the parlour. He lay as we had left him, on his back, with his eyes | treasureisland
open and one arm stretched out. | treasureisland
“Draw down the blind, Jim,” whispered my mother; “they might come and | treasureisland
watch outside. And now,” said she when I had done so, “we have to get | treasureisland
the key off THAT; and who's to touch it, I should like to know!” and she | treasureisland
gave a kind of sob as she said the words. | treasureisland
I went down on my knees at once. On the floor close to his hand there | treasureisland
was a little round of paper, blackened on the one side. I could not | treasureisland
doubt that this was the BLACK SPOT; and taking it up, I found written | treasureisland
on the other side, in a very good, clear hand, this short message: “You | treasureisland
have till ten tonight.” | treasureisland
“He had till ten, Mother,” said I; and just as I said it, our old clock | treasureisland
began striking. This sudden noise startled us shockingly; but the news | treasureisland
was good, for it was only six. | treasureisland
“Now, Jim,” she said, “that key.” | treasureisland
I felt in his pockets, one after another. A few small coins, a thimble, | treasureisland
and some thread and big needles, a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away | treasureisland
at the end, his gully with the crooked handle, a pocket compass, and a | treasureisland
tinder box were all that they contained, and I began to despair. | treasureisland
“Perhaps it's round his neck,” suggested my mother. | treasureisland
Overcoming a strong repugnance, I tore open his shirt at the neck, and | treasureisland
there, sure enough, hanging to a bit of tarry string, which I cut with | treasureisland
his own gully, we found the key. At this triumph we were filled with | treasureisland
hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had | treasureisland
slept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival. | treasureisland
It was like any other seaman's chest on the outside, the initial “B” | treasureisland
 burned on the top of it with a hot iron, and the corners somewhat | treasureisland
smashed and broken as by long, rough usage. | treasureisland
“Give me the key,” said my mother; and though the lock was very stiff, | treasureisland
she had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling. | treasureisland
A strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior, but nothing | treasureisland
was to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes, carefully | treasureisland
brushed and folded. They had never been worn, my mother said. Under | treasureisland
that, the miscellany began--a quadrant, a tin canikin, several sticks of | treasureisland
tobacco, two brace of very handsome pistols, a piece of bar silver, an | treasureisland
old Spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of | treasureisland
foreign make, a pair of compasses mounted with brass, and five or six | treasureisland
curious West Indian shells. I have often wondered since why he should | treasureisland
have carried about these shells with him in his wandering, guilty, and | treasureisland
hunted life. | treasureisland
In the meantime, we had found nothing of any value but the silver and | treasureisland
the trinkets, and neither of these were in our way. Underneath there | treasureisland
was an old boat-cloak, whitened with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar. My | treasureisland
mother pulled it up with impatience, and there lay before us, the last | treasureisland
things in the chest, a bundle tied up in oilcloth, and looking like | treasureisland
papers, and a canvas bag that gave forth, at a touch, the jingle of | treasureisland
gold. | treasureisland
“I'll show these rogues that I'm an honest woman,” said my mother. “I'll | treasureisland
have my dues, and not a farthing over. Hold Mrs. Crossley's bag.” And | treasureisland
she began to count over the amount of the captain's score from the | treasureisland
sailor's bag into the one that I was holding. | treasureisland
It was a long, difficult business, for the coins were of all countries | treasureisland
and sizes--doubloons, and louis d'ors, and guineas, and pieces of eight, | treasureisland
and I know not what besides, all shaken together at random. The guineas, | treasureisland
too, were about the scarcest, and it was with these only that my mother | treasureisland
knew how to make her count. | treasureisland
When we were about half-way through, I suddenly put my hand upon her | treasureisland
arm, for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my | treasureisland
heart into my mouth--the tap-tapping of the blind man's stick upon the | treasureisland
frozen road. It drew nearer and nearer, while we sat holding our breath. | treasureisland
Then it struck sharp on the inn door, and then we could hear the handle | treasureisland
being turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter; | treasureisland
and then there was a long time of silence both within and without. | treasureisland
At last the tapping recommenced, and, to our indescribable joy and | treasureisland
gratitude, died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard. | treasureisland
“Mother,” said I, “take the whole and let's be going,” for I was sure | treasureisland
the bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole | treasureisland
hornet's nest about our ears, though how thankful I was that I had | treasureisland
bolted it, none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man. | treasureisland
But my mother, frightened as she was, would not consent to take a | treasureisland
fraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be | treasureisland
content with less. It was not yet seven, she said, by a long way; she | treasureisland
knew her rights and she would have them; and she was still arguing with | treasureisland
me when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill. That | treasureisland
was enough, and more than enough, for both of us. | treasureisland
“I'll take what I have,” she said, jumping to her feet. | treasureisland
“And I'll take this to square the count,” said I, picking up the oilskin | treasureisland
packet. | treasureisland
Next moment we were both groping downstairs, leaving the candle by | treasureisland
the empty chest; and the next we had opened the door and were in full | treasureisland
retreat. We had not started a moment too soon. The fog was rapidly | treasureisland
dispersing; already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on | treasureisland
either side; and it was only in the exact bottom of the dell and round | treasureisland
the tavern door that a thin veil still hung unbroken to conceal the | treasureisland
first steps of our escape. Far less than half-way to the hamlet, very | treasureisland
little beyond the bottom of the hill, we must come forth into the | treasureisland
moonlight. Nor was this all, for the sound of several footsteps running | treasureisland
came already to our ears, and as we looked back in their direction, a | treasureisland
light tossing to and fro and still rapidly advancing showed that one of | treasureisland
the newcomers carried a lantern. | treasureisland
“My dear,” said my mother suddenly, “take the money and run on. I am | treasureisland
going to faint.” | treasureisland
This was certainly the end for both of us, I thought. How I cursed the | treasureisland
cowardice of the neighbours; how I blamed my poor mother for her honesty | treasureisland
and her greed, for her past foolhardiness and present weakness! We were | treasureisland
just at the little bridge, by good fortune; and I helped her, tottering | treasureisland
as she was, to the edge of the bank, where, sure enough, she gave a sigh | treasureisland
and fell on my shoulder. I do not know how I found the strength to do it | treasureisland
at all, and I am afraid it was roughly done, but I managed to drag her | treasureisland
down the bank and a little way under the arch. Farther I could not move | treasureisland
her, for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it. | treasureisland
So there we had to stay--my mother almost entirely exposed and both of | treasureisland
us within earshot of the inn. | treasureisland
5 | treasureisland
The Last of the Blind Man | treasureisland
MY curiosity, in a sense, was stronger than my fear, for I could not | treasureisland
remain where I was, but crept back to the bank again, whence, sheltering | treasureisland
my head behind a bush of broom, I might command the road before our | treasureisland
door. I was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive, seven | treasureisland
or eight of them, running hard, their feet beating out of time along | treasureisland
the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front. Three men ran | treasureisland
together, hand in hand; and I made out, even through the mist, that the | treasureisland
middle man of this trio was the blind beggar. The next moment his voice | treasureisland
showed me that I was right. | treasureisland
“Down with the door!” he cried. | treasureisland
“Aye, aye, sir!” answered two or three; and a rush was made upon the | treasureisland
Admiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then I could see | treasureisland
them pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were | treasureisland
surprised to find the door open. But the pause was brief, for the blind | treasureisland
man again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder and higher, as | treasureisland
if he were afire with eagerness and rage. | treasureisland
“In, in, in!” he shouted, and cursed them for their delay. | treasureisland
Four or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the | treasureisland
formidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a | treasureisland
voice shouting from the house, “Bill's dead.” | treasureisland
But the blind man swore at them again for their delay. | treasureisland
“Search him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and | treasureisland
get the chest,” he cried. | treasureisland
I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the | treasureisland
house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of | treasureisland
astonishment arose; the window of the captain's room was thrown open | treasureisland
with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the | treasureisland
moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the | treasureisland
road below him. | treasureisland
“Pew,” he cried, “they've been before us. Someone's turned the chest out | treasureisland
alow and aloft.” | treasureisland
“Is it there?” roared Pew. | treasureisland
“The money's there.” | treasureisland
The blind man cursed the money. | treasureisland
“Flint's fist, I mean,” he cried. | treasureisland
“We don't see it here nohow,” returned the man. | treasureisland
“Here, you below there, is it on Bill?” cried the blind man again. | treasureisland
At that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search | treasureisland
the captain's body, came to the door of the inn. “Bill's been overhauled | treasureisland
a'ready,” said he; “nothin' left.” | treasureisland
“It's these people of the inn--it's that boy. I wish I had put his eyes | treasureisland
out!” cried the blind man, Pew. “There were no time ago--they had the | treasureisland
door bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and find 'em.” | treasureisland
“Sure enough, they left their glim here,” said the fellow from the | treasureisland
window. | treasureisland
“Scatter and find 'em! Rout the house out!” reiterated Pew, striking | treasureisland
with his stick upon the road. | treasureisland
Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet | treasureisland
pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the | treasureisland
very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on | treasureisland
the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just | treasureisland
the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead | treasureisland
captain's money was once more clearly audible through the night, | treasureisland
but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man's | treasureisland
trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found | treasureisland
that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its | treasureisland
effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger. | treasureisland
“There's Dirk again,” said one. “Twice! We'll have to budge, mates.” | treasureisland
“Budge, you skulk!” cried Pew. “Dirk was a fool and a coward from the | treasureisland
first--you wouldn't mind him. They must be close by; they can't be far; | treasureisland
you have your hands on it. Scatter and look for them, dogs! Oh, shiver | treasureisland
my soul,” he cried, “if I had eyes!” | treasureisland
This appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began | treasureisland
to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought, | treasureisland
and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest | treasureisland
stood irresolute on the road. | treasureisland
“You have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You'd | treasureisland
be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it's here, and | treasureisland
you stand there skulking. There wasn't one of you dared face Bill, and | treasureisland
I did it--a blind man! And I'm to lose my chance for you! I'm to be a | treasureisland
poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a | treasureisland
coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch | treasureisland
them still.” | treasureisland
“Hang it, Pew, we've got the doubloons!” grumbled one. | treasureisland
“They might have hid the blessed thing,” said another. “Take the | treasureisland
Georges, Pew, and don't stand here squalling.” | treasureisland
Squalling was the word for it; Pew's anger rose so high at these | treasureisland
objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand, | treasureisland
he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded | treasureisland
heavily on more than one. | treasureisland
These, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him | treasureisland
in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from | treasureisland
his grasp. | treasureisland
This quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging, | treasureisland
another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the | treasureisland
hamlet--the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a | treasureisland
pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was | treasureisland
plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once | treasureisland
and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one | treasureisland
slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of | treasureisland
them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic | treasureisland
or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he | treasureisland
remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping | treasureisland
and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few | treasureisland
steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, “Johnny, Black Dog, Dirk,” | treasureisland
 and other names, “you won't leave old Pew, mates--not old Pew!” | treasureisland
Just then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders | treasureisland
came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope. | treasureisland
At this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for | treasureisland
the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a | treasureisland
second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the | treasureisland
nearest of the coming horses. | treasureisland
The rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that | treasureisland
rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him | treasureisland
and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face | treasureisland
and moved no more. | treasureisland
I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any | treasureisland
rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One, | treasureisland
tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to | treasureisland
Dr. Livesey's; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the | treasureisland
way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some | treasureisland
news of the lugger in Kitt's Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance | treasureisland
and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance | treasureisland
my mother and I owed our preservation from death. | treasureisland
Pew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up | treasureisland
to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her | treasureisland
back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still | treasureisland
continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the | treasureisland
supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt's Hole; but his men | treasureisland
had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes | treasureisland
supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was | treasureisland
no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the | treasureisland
lugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A | treasureisland
voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get | treasureisland
some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his | treasureisland
arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance | treasureisland
stood there, as he said, “like a fish out of water,” and all he could do | treasureisland
was to dispatch a man to B---- to warn the cutter. “And that,” said he, | treasureisland
“is just about as good as nothing. They've got off clean, and there's | treasureisland
an end. Only,” he added, “I'm glad I trod on Master Pew's corns,” for by | treasureisland
this time he had heard my story. | treasureisland
I went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a | treasureisland
house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down | treasureisland
by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself; | treasureisland
and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain's | treasureisland
money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we | treasureisland
were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene. | treasureisland
“They got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were | treasureisland
they after? More money, I suppose?” | treasureisland
“No, sir; not money, I think,” replied I. “In fact, sir, I believe I | treasureisland
have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should | treasureisland
like to get it put in safety.” | treasureisland
“To be sure, boy; quite right,” said he. “I'll take it, if you like.” | treasureisland
“I thought perhaps Dr. Livesey--” I began. | treasureisland
“Perfectly right,” he interrupted very cheerily, “perfectly right--a | treasureisland
gentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as | treasureisland
well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew's | treasureisland
dead, when all's done; not that I regret it, but he's dead, you see, and | treasureisland
people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty's revenue, | treasureisland
if make it out they can. Now, I'll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I'll | treasureisland
take you along.” | treasureisland
I thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet | treasureisland
where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they | treasureisland
were all in the saddle. | treasureisland
“Dogger,” said Mr. Dance, “you have a good horse; take up this lad | treasureisland
behind you.” | treasureisland
As soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger's belt, the supervisor | treasureisland
gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road | treasureisland
to Dr. Livesey's house. | treasureisland
6 | treasureisland
The Captain's Papers | treasureisland
WE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey's door. The | treasureisland
house was all dark to the front. | treasureisland
Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock, and Dogger gave me a stirrup | treasureisland
to descend by. The door was opened almost at once by the maid. | treasureisland
“Is Dr. Livesey in?” I asked. | treasureisland
No, she said, he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the | treasureisland
hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire. | treasureisland
“So there we go, boys,” said Mr. Dance. | treasureisland
This time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran with | treasureisland
Dogger's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long, leafless, | treasureisland
moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on | treasureisland
either hand on great old gardens. Here Mr. Dance dismounted, and taking | treasureisland
me along with him, was admitted at a word into the house. | treasureisland
The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a | treasureisland
great library, all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them, | treasureisland
where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat, pipe in hand, on either side of a | treasureisland
bright fire. | treasureisland
I had never seen the squire so near at hand. He was a tall man, over six | treasureisland
feet high, and broad in proportion, and he had a bluff, rough-and-ready | treasureisland
face, all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels. His | treasureisland
eyebrows were very black, and moved readily, and this gave him a look of | treasureisland
some temper, not bad, you would say, but quick and high. | treasureisland
“Come in, Mr. Dance,” says he, very stately and condescending. | treasureisland
“Good evening, Dance,” says the doctor with a nod. “And good evening to | treasureisland
you, friend Jim. What good wind brings you here?” | treasureisland
The supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a | treasureisland
lesson; and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward | treasureisland
and looked at each other, and forgot to smoke in their surprise and | treasureisland
interest. When they heard how my mother went back to the inn, Dr. | treasureisland
Livesey fairly slapped his thigh, and the squire cried “Bravo!” and | treasureisland
broke his long pipe against the grate. Long before it was done, Mr. | treasureisland
Trelawney (that, you will remember, was the squire's name) had got up | treasureisland
from his seat and was striding about the room, and the doctor, as if to | treasureisland
hear the better, had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking | treasureisland
very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll. | treasureisland
At last Mr. Dance finished the story. | treasureisland
“Mr. Dance,” said the squire, “you are a very noble fellow. And as for | treasureisland
riding down that black, atrocious miscreant, I regard it as an act of | treasureisland
virtue, sir, like stamping on a cockroach. This lad Hawkins is a trump, | treasureisland
I perceive. Hawkins, will you ring that bell? Mr. Dance must have some | treasureisland
ale.” | treasureisland
“And so, Jim,” said the doctor, “you have the thing that they were | treasureisland
after, have you?” | treasureisland
“Here it is, sir,” said I, and gave him the oilskin packet. | treasureisland
The doctor looked it all over, as if his fingers were itching to open | treasureisland
it; but instead of doing that, he put it quietly in the pocket of his | treasureisland
coat. | treasureisland
“Squire,” said he, “when Dance has had his ale he must, of course, be | treasureisland
